It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager.,['as']

Parry firm over Gerrard  Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from 1900 GMT.,['and']
"But Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future.","['but', 'also']"
"It doesnt matter if its £30m, £40m or £50m, we will not accept offers.",['or']
But we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep Steven against his will.,"['but', 'also']"
"On the subject of Liverpools finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.",['also']
"And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan.","['but', 'and']"
Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League.,['as']
"There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield , and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard.",['and']
"On the subject of Liverpools captain and prize asset, Parry revealed Real Madrid  did  ask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes.",['and']
"He said: They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same , Steven is not for sale",['but']
"But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: I sincerely hope he will be.","['but', 'when', 'next']"
We crave success as much as he does.,"['as', 'much as']"
We know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that.,['and']
I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than hed like to do anything else.,['else']
We all want to see progress by next season.,['next']
"There are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim.",['so']
"It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a £30m,plus bid in the summer , but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.",['but']
We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him.,"['as', 'and']"
"Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven , and he has enough respect for us , to know that it is his decision that will be crucial.","['but', 'and', 'also']"
"That just doesnt work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda.","['but', 'then', 'and']"
"And he confessed Arsenals £100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground , complete with naming rights , has given the Anfield club serious food for thought.",['and']
"He said: I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record as saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye,opener.","['but', 'as', 'and']"
I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating.,['and']
"But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow , thats interesting.","['but', 'and']"
"Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team.","['but', 'and']"
"Thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore",['but']
"On the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East.",['still']
"That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board.",['and']
"He also accused Liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids, but Parry explained: Steve has never been used as a stalking horse.","['but', 'as', 'also']"
"Theres no need, and that is not the way we do business.",['and']
I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen.,['but']
"Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it.","['as', 'and', 'so']"
We are still evaluating it.,['still']
"Thats a dream we all share, so as far as Im concerned the door is not closed.","['as', 'so']"
"I would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him.",['but']
"I dont care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.",['and']
"£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it.",['however']
I would however be happy with Gerrards transfer for any fee over £35m.,['however']
Parrys statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players.,"['as', 'and']"
No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.,['and']
The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy.,['and']
"Clearly, if he isnt, then we would be foolish not to sell.","['then', 'if,then']"
"But Wright,Phillips will not make his first start for England playing on the left, as had been widely expected.","['but', 'as']"

"Eriksson also revealed that Wes Brown will start alongside Jamie Carragher in the injury,hit centre of defence.",['also']
When asked if Brown and Carragher would start Eriksson replied: I could tell you yes.,"['when', 'and']"
Its a blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries.,"['because', 'or']"
On the other hand its good for Carragher and Brown to show what they can do at this level. Thats positive,"['on the other hand', 'and']"
He has been playing well all season and I look forward to seeing him.,['and']
"And he added that Andy Johnson and Stewart Downing , the other two new players in the squad , would also get a chance to impress.","['and', 'also']"
"Wright,Phillips, Downing and Johnson will start or get the chance to play some part.","['and', 'or']"
Johnson was not in my plans a year ago but he is doing a great season and scoring a lot of goals.,"['but', 'and']"
"He is young, talented and there are not too many left,footed players in the squad.",['and']
Robben sidelined with broken foot  Chelsea winger Arjen Robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.,['and']
Six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then I need a few more weeks to be completely fit again,"['then', 'and']"
I had a feeling it was serious but because of the swelling it was impossible to make a final diagnosis,"['but', 'because']"
"The 21,year,old missed the first three months of the season with a similar injury after a challenge with Romas Olivier Dacourt.",['after']
And he added: It felt different then last summer when I had the same injury on my other foot.,"['then', 'when', 'and']"
Then I could walk already after three days but I stayed sidelined for a long period.,"['but', 'then', 'after']"
The fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month,"['and', 'next']"
But this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last World Cup and which has kept Scott Parker out for two months,"['but', 'and', 'so', 'since']"
David Beckham suffered a broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan.,['and']
"Robben, who has been a key part of the Blues push for four trophies, claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by Blackburn midfielder Aaron Mokoena.",['when']

Giggs handed Wales leading role  Ryan Giggs will captain Wales as he wins his 50th cap in Wednesdays friendly against Hungary in Cardiff.,['as']
"John Toshack, in his first game as coach after succeeding Mark Hughes, admits he is surprised that Giggs has only just reached the landmark.","['as', 'after']"
But hes one of the greatest of all Welsh internationals and on his 50th cap its appropriate hes captain,"['but', 'and']"
"Giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game, but is now targetting playing for Wales in the 2008 European Championships.",['but']
"I briefly discussed my international future with Sir Alex, but he urged me to carry on",['but']
"He feels, like myself, that I have no weight problems and keep myself fit, so in three or four years time I will be able to play in the European finals if we get there.","['and', 'so', 'or']"
The manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because I am fit enough,"['and', 'because']"
"Giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former Wales skipper Gary Speed and United team,mate Paul Scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football.",['and']
But Giggs is now focussed on making the Toshack era even more successful than the time Hughes spent at the helm.,['but']
"The Manchester United winger won his first cap as a 17,year,old in 1991, an away loss to Germany, and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31.","['as', 'and']"

"On Wednesday night Toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing Hughes, and Giggs said: Its my 50th cap and I am looking forward to it, and I hope to play a lot more times from here on in.","['and', 'since']"

Parry relishes Anfield challenge  BBC Sport reflects on the future for Liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive Rick Parry.,['after']
Chief executive Parry is the man at the helm as Liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history.,['as']
He is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore Liverpool to their place at European footballs top table.,"['and', 'also']"
"But it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with Parry, who has forged a reputation as one of footballs most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling Premier League.","['but', 'as', 'since']"
"Liverpool have not won the championship since 1990, a fact that causes deep discomfort inside Anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal.","['as', 'and', 'since']"
"Throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain Steven Gerrard, and you can see Parry is a man with a lot on his plate.","['as', 'and']"
"But in the comfort of a conference room deep inside Liverpools heartbeat , The Kop end , Parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead.",['but']
"He only dodged one question , when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting Liverpool, a polite smile deflected the inquiry.",['when']
"But to his credit, he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that Liverpool still mean business.","['but', 'else', 'still']"
"By business he means becoming title challengers again, and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to Liverpool is Parrys mission.",['and']
And his enthusiasm for the Spaniards personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold.,['and']
But it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations.,"['but', 'and']"
"This will not come as news to Parry, a lifelong Liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting.","['but', 'as']"
"As ever, the player will have the final say, and Parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for Liverpool and Gerrard to flourish.","['but', 'as', 'and']"
"In terms of the search for new investment, Hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in March 2004.",['as']
"Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shiniwatra came and went, while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan Steve Morgan.","['while', 'and']"
"BBC Sport understands Morgan is still ready and willing to invest in Liverpool, and Parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.","['still', 'and']"
"Morgan, however, has had no formal contact with Liverpool or their advisors since last December, blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his £70m offer.","['however', 'as', 'or', 'since']"
"He was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others, so any new approach would now have to come from Liverpool.","['also', 'so']"
"So speculation continues about the new benefactor, with trails leading to the Middle East and America, but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from Anfield.","['but', 'and', 'so']"
"Parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to Liverpools future, but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea.","['but', 'as', 'meanwhile']"
He is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future Liverpool management hostages to the new stadium.,['and']
"Parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up, but there has been a vital new development in North London that has re,shaped Liverpools thinking.",['but']
"Liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights , but the realism of Arsenals stunning £100m deal for their new Emirates Stadium at Ashburton has changed the landscape.","['but', 'and']"
"Parry labelled the deal an eye,opener and admits Liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities.",['and']
"He knows some traditionalist Liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just Anfield, but the maths of modern,day football decree that multi,millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.","['but', 'and']"
"Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.",['and']
"I would say its 50,50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so.","['and', 'so', 'or']"
"It would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured.",['as']
But international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing.,"['but', 'because']"
"The more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter,finals against Brazil.",['when']
"Often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half.","['though', 'then', 'and']"
"And its very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole teams worth.","['as', 'and']"
"The debate will rage on, and Im not sure there is a satisfactory solution.",['and']
The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts.,"['instead', 'since']"
The players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers.,"['and', 'before', 'next']"
"If he had sent them out on Wednesday and they had been badly beaten, it would have done them no good whatsoever.",['and']
"John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary.",['and']
"He will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance, but the public wants results.","['but', 'and']"
"If you win, people forget them, but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you.",['but']
It looks like a good opportunity to try out players like Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing or Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson.,['or']
"But you have got to remember Sven,Goran Erikssons side were given a lesson by Spain in the last game they played.",['but']

Were happy to be in the draw but weve still got to beat a Premiership team.,"['but', 'still']"
Weve got to beat Southampton first and thats going to be a hard game but if we do there will be some celebration,"['but', 'and']"
It is obviously going to be a difficult replay judging by the way Brentford came back at us on Saturday and the fact that United have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive.,['and']
But Ive been drawn against United so many times in cups and beaten them at both Bournemouth and West Ham.,"['but', 'and', 'so']"
There are no easy ties in the FA Cup and Im sure nobody is counting on one,['and']
"Chelseas John Terry and Wayne Bridge are also out, leaving coach Sven,Goran Eriksson with a real problem for Wednesdays match at Villa Park.","['and', 'also']"
"Injured Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell were both left out of the squad, and Matthew Upson has already pulled out.",['and']
Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership.,['and']
"Terry, the captain of Chelsea as they push for the Premiership title, would have been a certain starter in the absence of Campbell and Ferdinand.","['as', 'and']"
"But now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by Carragher, alongside Brown.","['but', 'and']"
"The 25,year,old was only called into the squad on Sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of Upson, who has a hamstring injury.",['as']

Ferdinand casts doubt over Glazer  Rio Ferdinand has said he is unsure of Malcolm Glazers motives after the American billionaire launched a new offer to buy Manchester United.,['after']
A lot of people want the clubs interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart,['and']
The central defender added on BBC Radio Five Live: We will have to wait and see what Glazer comes with.,['and']
I think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals.,['and']
"Glazer, currently owns a 28.1% stake in the club, and Uniteds statement to the stock exchange said: The board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject.",['and']
A further announcement will be made in due course,['further']
"Glazers previous bids for the club, which United supporters opposed, were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur.",['because']
But it is believed that Glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move.,['but']
"He will still need the approval of major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who own 28.9% of the club to succeed.","['still', 'and']"
"But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake, while fans remain opposed to his involvement.","['but', 'while']"
"Both Chelsea and Arsenal will be asked to give evidence to a Premier League commission, but no deadline has been put on when that meeting will convene.","['but', 'when', 'and']"

Arsenal and England defender Cole reportedly met Blues boss Jose Mourinho and chief executive Peter Kenyon in a London hotel 11 days ago.,['and']

"And his Arsenal team,mate Robert Pires has urged the England left,back to stay at Highbury.",['and']
"He is a very attacking left,back and I think he is enjoying his football because at Arsenal he plays in an offensive team.","['and', 'because']"
"I am not sure he will get the same pleasure at Chelsea, even though they are doing so well at the moment.","['though', 'so']"
"We play together so well , we could do it with our eyes shut.",['so']
But you have to respect the decision of the player.,['but']
But Sturrock has distanced himself from the position.,['but']
Ian McCall and I have had a long and detailed talk about a number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the League Cup,['and']
"However, the continuing speculation is doing no one any good, especially as we have several crucial games coming up.","['however', 'as']"
The minds of the coaching staff and the players have to be on those games and those games only.,['and']
"Our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semi,final, subject to the draw.","['and', 'also', 'next']"
"All that matters at the present time , is us all having a total focus on the games ahead and a positive series of results being achieved",['and']
"Dundee United players had expressed their solidarity with McCall after their sides 3,0 Scottish Cup win over Queen of the South.",['after']

I can appreciate the rumours because Ive emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to Dundee United.,"['and', 'because']"
"I had five years there as a coach, six as a player, two years as a manager , once youve done that kind of thing, its the result you look for.","['once', 'as']"

Next years Brazilian Championship only gets underway at the end of April.,['next']
"Until then he will have to make do with the foolish S&227,o Paulo State Championship, an appalling waste of his talent.","['then', 'until']"

Much was made of Vogts inability to express himself to the players and media.,['and']
"The former Dundee United and Dumbarton full,back is from the managerial old school , straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better .","['when', 'and']"
"But it should be remembered Vogts came to Scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae , a World Cup winner as a player and a European Championships winner as a manager.","['but', 'as', 'and']"

Referees chief Keith Hackett believes Mourinho should retract his comments about Ferguson and Barry as he believes the Blues boss has questioned their integrity.,"['as', 'and']"
I dont want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers.,['or']

Stuart Gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager.,['as']
Weve worked together at Southampton and Im delighted to be back with him.,['and']
We hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term,['and']

Gerrard future not decided by Cardiff loss  Steven Gerrards own goal in Liverpools Carling Cup defeat against Chelsea sparked yet another round of speculation about his Anfield future.,['yet']

"It was just one of those things that could have happened anywhere at any time, in any place and in any game.",['and']
"It wasnt even a mistake, although you could say the mistake was in three Liverpool defenders going for the same ball.",['although']
"But to pull together a sub,plot or conspiracy theory that the own goal, combined with Liverpools defeat, has finally put Gerrard on the road to Stamford Bridge is nonsense.","['but', 'finally', 'or']"

And that is ensuring Liverpool qualify for the Champions League by getting that fourth place in the Premiership.,['and']
"I dont think any decision has been made, and will certainly not be influenced by anything that happened in Cardiff on Sunday.",['and']
Liverpool must hope they clinch fourth place and that is enough to persuade their massively influential captain to stay.,['and']

I think Rafael Benitez is on the right lines and speaks with a lot of confidence about his team and what he wants from them.,['and']

"What they cannot afford to do is produce any performances like they produced at Burnley, Southampton or Birmingham.",['or']
"If they slip up at Newcastle then Everton beat Blackburn 24 hours later, that will be an 11,point gap and thats an awful long way back for them in the race for the Champions League place.","['then', 'and', 'if,then', 'later']"
There is added spice because Everton are fourth.,['because']
"They had an impressive win at Aston Villa, and you cannot take away from them what they have done.",['and']
"Theyve had an uncertain spell recently, but theyve picked up points here and there and that is a great tribute to manager David Moyes and his players.","['but', 'and']"
"And in Tim Cahill, theyve paid £2m for a player from outside the Premiership who has proved himself in the top,flight.",['and']
"Liverpool will still be a massive magnet for top players, but they may also need to seek out the type of signings that Moyes has pulled off with Cahill.","['but', 'still', 'also']"
He has been excellent since arriving from Millwall and has been a very sound purchase by Moyes.,"['and', 'since']"
"While the battle for fourth hots up, Manchester United turned the screw a little tighter on leaders Chelsea by beating Portsmouth and reducing the gap to six points , albeit with a game in hand for Jose Mourinhos side.","['while', 'and']"
"The Carling Cup win against Liverpool was massive for Chelsea, because it stopped all the inevitable questions that would have been posed if they had lost three games in a week.",['because']
"I dont think they answered all the questions, because for all their long periods of possession they were struggling to score until Gerrards unfortunate intervention.","['because', 'until']"
"Obviously a lot of focus has been centred on Mourinho for events on and off the pitch, but I think he will be more than happy with that because it means the heat is taken off his players.","['but', 'and', 'because']"
"If people are asking questions about the manager, they are leaving the players in peace, so Mourinho will settle for that.",['so']
"And while United are showing once again there is no,one better when it comes to the chase, I dont think there is any shift in the balance of power in the Premiership.","['once', 'while', 'when', 'and']"
"It is all Chelseas to lose, with a six,point lead and a game in hand.",['and']
"Throw in that their next four league games are against the bottom four sides in the table, and you can see they are in a strong position.","['and', 'next']"

The FA has taken some knocks and it will be up to him to pick the organisation up again so it is respected by all parts of the game,"['and', 'so']"

"Caborn added: The most important issue coming up is the independent review by Lord Burns, and Brian will need to act on the recommendations to ensure that a good system of governance is brought into the FA. We have 40,000 football clubs in this country, it is our national game, and it is important that the FA has the authority and leadership to deal with the game from the England team at the very top right down to the grass,roots",['and']

Its impossible to get them all right and everyone has got to take a greater level of responsibility,['and']
Pedro Mendes shot clearly crossed the line and Lewis has been criticised for his positioning in the incident.,['and']
Lewis said: The Spurs player shot from distance and I was doing my primary job which was to stand in line with the last defender and watch for an offside.,['and']
He added: When the ball landed I was still 25 yards from goal and it was impossible to judge if it had crossed the line,"['still', 'when', 'and']"

"Molby told BBC Sport: It is a little bit of a surprise, but there is no doubt the talent is there with Thomas.",['but']
"They will be looking for him to be the strong man, but he has exceptional ability.",['but']
Gravesen is out of contract at the end of the season and would be able to leave on a free transfer but Real are expected to pay up to £2.5m to sign the midfielder in January.,"['but', 'and']"
"Molby said: The strength of the majority of the players at Real is going forward, and maybe not having a lot of defensive qualities.",['and']
"Thomas has been playing more of a free role this season at Everton, but when he plays for Denmark he has a lot of defensive duties and he can do that as well.","['but', 'as', 'when', 'as well', 'and']"
"Real will want Thomas to sit in there and make them defensively sound, with all the superstars going forward.",['and']
"But he can be trusted with the ball, and if he does venture forward he is more than good enough to do some fancy work.","['but', 'and']"
"Gravesen is a strong personality and a major figure at Everton , but he will be reduced to the ranks among the big names assembled at The Bernabeu.","['but', 'and']"
Molby said: Thomas likes to be the leader and he wouldnt go down as a galactico signing.,"['as', 'and']"
"It will be interesting to see what happens the first time he gets upset with Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo or Raul for not tracking back , but thats all part of the way he is.","['but', 'or']"
He is a strong personality and he has to keep that if he is to function at 100%.,['and']

"People talk about the success of Tim Cahill, Lee Carsley playing well in the holding role, Marcus Bents goals and the work of the defensive boys , but the catalyst is always Thomas Gravesen.","['but', 'and']"

Ireland coach Eddie OSullivan was surprised that England coach Andy Robinson said he was certain Mark Cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break.,['before']
Andy was sitting two yards from me and I couldnt see whether he was offside or not so I dont know how Andy could have known,"['and', 'so', 'or']"
What I do know is that England played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us.,"['when', 'and']"
We had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team.,['and']

We had our first attack in the Italian half after 22 minutes,['after']
"We had a good return, with three first,half possessions in their half and we scored twice.",['and']
"Scrum,half Peter Stringer was also glad that Ireland escaped wtih a victory.",['also']
They always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit.,['and']
They had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their 22,"['but', 'when']"
A pair of classic outside breaks from the Ireland captain set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer.,['and']
"Italy led 9,8 early in the second half but Stringers try gave Ireland a lead they never lost.",['but']
"The hosts cut the gap to 18,12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through Ludovico Nitoglia, but Denis Hickies try ensured an Irish victory.","['but', 'and']"
Italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a Luciano Orquera penalty after seven minutes.,"['and', 'after']"
"It could have been better for the hosts but the fly,half missed two kickable penalties and Ireland drew level with a Ronan OGara penalty midway through the first half.","['but', 'and']"
"The Italians were driving at the heart of the Irish defence and, for the first quarter, the Irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.",['and']
"When they finally did, just before the half,hour mark, ODriscoll promptly created a sparkling try for Murphy.","['when', 'finally', 'before']"
"The Ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full,back and putting the diving Murphy in at the corner.","['and', 'before']"
"OGara missed the twice,taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again.","['once', 'and']"
"Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9,8 lead.",['and']
"The only Ireland player offering a real threat was ODriscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors.",['and']
"Shane Horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and Stringer scooted over, with OGara landing the tricky conversion.","['as', 'and']"
"A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading 18,12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks.","['but', 'as', 'when']"
Winger Nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and Italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.,"['as', 'and']"
An OGara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try.,"['when', 'and']"
"ODriscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner Gordon DArcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to Italy.",['and']
"Jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when Wales, 9,8 down, were awarded a long,range penalty with four minutes left in Cardiff.","['when', 'earlier']"
"When he said he wanted it, there were no problems",['when']
"Jones had seen a long,range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour, before Charlie Hodgson put England in front with 10 minutes left.",['before']
I looked at where it was and I knew I was going to struggle to make it,['and']
I said to Gareth  This is touch and go.,['and']
It was out of my range and obviously Gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance.,"['when', 'and']"
He was confident and fancied it.,['and']
Jones was happy to hail Hensons heroic contribution to Wales first win over England in Cardiff since 1993.,['since']
"Physically hes a specimen: hes a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously hes got a great kicking game as well","['as', 'when', 'and']"
"His defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game.",['and']
Victory over England for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what Wales might achieve in this years Six Nations.,['since']
"But they now face three away fixtures in Italy, France and Scotland before completing their campaign against Ireland in Cardiff.","['but', 'and', 'before']"
But we are not there yet.,"['but', 'yet']"
The next step is finding the consistency to get further wins.,"['further', 'next']"
We have to travel this week and we cant afford to get too giddy about this result.,['and']
We have got to be professional and keep focused on facing Italy,['and']
"None more so than Henson, who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of Jonny Wilkinson and Brian ODriscoll.","['as', 'and', 'so']"
"The confident 23,year,old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however.",['however']
It makes me more concentrated and I think I perform better under more pressure.,['and']
I set a high standard against England and Ive got to back it up next week.,"['and', 'next']"
"Two years ago when we played Italy I wasnt involved and we lost, so weve got to put that right next week","['when', 'and', 'so', 'next']"
Double injury blow strikes Wales  Wales centre Sonny Parker and number eight Ryan Jones will miss Saturdays game with Italy because of injury.,"['and', 'because']"
"Parker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over England, and Tom Shanklin is expected to continue at centre.",['and']
Jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as a replacement against England and joins flanker Colin Charvis  on the sidelines.,"['as', 'and', 'after']"
"Meanwhile, Mike Ruddock may make Gavin Henson his first,choice kicker in Rome.",['meanwhile']
"First,choice kicker Stephen Jones handed over responsibility because of Hensons greater kicking range, but the fly,half had already missed a number of shots at goal.","['but', 'because']"
"Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but giving him the kicks is something well talk about in selection this week",['but']
Henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last Saturdays game.,['since']
I thrive on it and think it makes me perform better,['and']
Im glad its a short week before the Italy game.,['before']
"There was so much build,up before England, but we fly out to Rome on Thursday and well be back playing again.","['but', 'and', 'so', 'before']"
Kirwan demands Italy consistency  Italy coach John Kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing Ireland close when they meet Wales on Saturday.,['when']
Our goal is to match every side we face and against Ireland we showed we could do that,['and']
But the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play Wales on Saturday,"['but', 'when']"
"Italys half,backs had a mixed afternoon, with recalled scrum,half Alessandro Troncon impressing but fly,half Luciano Orquera having an off,day with the boot.",['but']
"He had an incredible game , he was very good in attack and defence.",['and']
Orqueras kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence.,['but']
He also followed the game plan.,['also']
We have to give him confidence because he has the capability to do well.,['because']
"But the player, who missed the victory over Scotland through injury, must attend a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday after being cited by Wasps.","['but', 'after']"
Serge has a good case so we are confident he will play,['so']
"The inexperienced Nicolas Mas, Jimmy Marlu and Jean,Philippe Grandclaude are also included in a 22,man squad.","['and', 'also']"
"The trio have been called up after Pieter de Villiers, Ludovic Valbon and Aurelien Rougerie all picked up injuries in Frances 16,9 win on Saturday.","['and', 'after']"
"If he was to be suspended, we would call up Imanol Harinordoquy or Thomas Lievremont",['or']
He has now recovered from his thigh injury and played on Saturday with Biarritz.,['and']
"Frances regular back,row combination of Betsen, Harinordoquy and Olivier Magne were all missing from Frances side at the weekend because of injury.","['and', 'because']"
"Wales critical of clumsy Grewcock  Wales coach Mike Ruddock says England lock Danny Grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked Dwayne Peel.  Trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of Wales 11,9 win in Cardiff as Grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot, leaving Peel bloodied.","['as', 'after']"
"Im not saying its deliberate, but Grewcock did a similar thing for Bath against Leinster",['but']
"Six years earlier, also in New Zealand, Grewcock became only the second England player to be sent off in Tests.","['also', 'earlier']"
The player himself and his captain Jason Robinson have both said that the clash with Peel was accidental.,['and']
If the ball is at the back of the ruck and I feel I can step over and disrupt it then I will do that,"['then', 'and']"
But Ruddock feels that the England man should be more careful.,['but']
"Hes a great player and I dont want to knock him, we wont be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident.",['and']
It could just be a clumsy action and Dwayne had just a minor cut.,['and']
Ruddock also warned his RBS 6 Nations Championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements.,['also']
We created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually,"['and', 'also']"
Weve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely a lot of chances that we wasted,['and']
"In the forthcoming games, Ruddock may use penalty hero Gavin Henson as his first,choice kicker in place of Stephen Jones.",['as']
"Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but its something well talk about in selection this week",['but']
Henson stakes early Lions claim  The Six Nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four Home Unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to New Zealand with the Lions this summer.,"['but', 'also']"
"You just had to listen to his interview afterwards , he beamed with confidence , but although theres an element of arrogance its good arrogance.","['although', 'but']"
"He once showed a clean pair of heels to Mathew Tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand.","['once', 'when', 'and']"
"And thats without even mentioning his majestic match,winning penalty.",['and']
But I think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test.,"['but', 'and', 'because']"
He needs to come up against Brian ODriscoll or a big French midfield.,['or']
"He gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side.",['and']
"With Jonny Wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and Jones, or maybe even Henson, could make the Lions team at fly,half.","['and', 'or']"
Jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than Charlie Hodgson after Saturdays game.,"['and', 'after']"
"Some of the Wales forwards surprised me because I thought they would be out,muscled in the tight five.",['because']
England prop Julian White is a capable player but when it comes down to selection Gethin Jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top.,"['but', 'when', 'because']"
"However, I still think White and Phil Vickery will be in the frame.","['however', 'still', 'and']"
I thought Joe Worsley had a solid game and Jason Robinson and Josh Lewsey both did nothing wrong.,['and']
But it looked too soon for young Mathew Tait and I think it will be a while before we see him again.,"['but', 'while', 'and', 'before']"
"Tom Smith has been there and done it before, but the likes of Chris Cusiter, Jason White and Ally Hogg all made their mark.","['but', 'and', 'before']"
"Hogg made a couple of good runs while White had a pretty robust game , his defence is right up there.",['while']
Cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward.,['and']
"He ran some good lines against Italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although Italy defended man on man which made it easy for him.","['although', 'and']"
"Gordon DArcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but I think you could get a Henson, DArcy, ODriscoll combination in the Lions midfield.",['but']
"Paul OConnell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and Malcolm OKelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while Shane Byrne seems to be a lively character.","['while', 'and']"
"But they will be a bit worried after the Italian pack drove them off their own ball on Sunday, although I used to play in Italy and I know how difficult it can be.","['although', 'but', 'and', 'after']"
"One player who didnt impress me was Wales scrum,half Dwayne Peel. He choked late on in the second half when Wales were trailing.",['when']
"They had good possession and he kicked the ball away , I wouldnt want him as my Lions scrum,half after that.","['as', 'and', 'after']"
It was very physical and fair play to the Italians they made us work very hard for our victory.,['and']
"Their organisation was very, very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by.","['as', 'and']"
It was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early.,['when']
We had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually.,['and']
It was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it.,['and']
"Im not too bad, but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on Monday morning.","['but', 'or']"
"In the backs, we were not frustrated at such, but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical.",['but']
The different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult.,['and']
But we managed to get the ball in our hands and I got a try near the end of the first half.,"['but', 'and']"
It was great work by Brian and I always knew I had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee.,"['though', 'and']"
"Eddie  was very calm at half,time even though we were only 8,6 ahead.",['though']
He spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory.,['and']
"We were penalised a lot at the breakdown, and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break.",['and']
So really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball.,"['and', 'so']"
Every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to Brian and Gordon.,"['and', 'after']"
"As yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries, but it does not that good.","['but', 'yet', 'as']"
Now we have to focus on Scotland and only six days to recover.,['and']
Its a big ask after such a bruising encounter.,['after']
It could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions.,"['but', 'so']"
"In the meantime, when in Rome .","['when', 'meantime']"
"And in the pack Neath,Swansea Ospreys forward Ryan Jones is preferred at blindside flanker to Jonathan Thomas.",['and']
"Thomas, a try,scorer in Rome, drops down to the bench instead of Ian Gough, while Cardiff back Rhys Williams steps up in place of Morgan.","['instead', 'while']"
"However, the experienced and in,form Morgan was already pushing hard for a start at Stade de France.","['however', 'and']"
"Due to his impressive performances from the bench, Kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway, and the unfortunate injury to Hal gives him the chance to start",['and']
"Now that Ryan Jones has recovered from injury, we have increased the options in the back row.",['now that']
"Jonathan Thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against Italy and scoring a try, but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail.","['but', 'and', 'after']"
"For this particular game, we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against Italy, so an extra big ball,carrier in the back,row is thought to be necessary on this occasion.",['so']
"Obviously, its a 22,man game these days, and there is every chance that Jonathan will be making an impact from the bench",['and']
"Wales have beaten France on two of their last three visits to Paris, and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first Five or Six Nations title triumph since 1994.","['and', 'or', 'since']"
"Graham Henry  said a couple of years ago that we should be bold when going to France, and he was proved right","['when', 'and']"
"That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week","['further', 'and']"
"Hugo Southwells try gave the Scots an early 8,0 lead but scores from locks Malcolm OKelly and Paul OConnell put the visitors in command by half,time.","['but', 'and']"
"A third try from wing Denis Hickie and third penalty from Ronan OGara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead.",['and']
Jon Petrie scored a second try for Scotland but late scores from John Hayes and Gavin Duffy sealed victory.,"['but', 'and']"
"After two hard,earned away victories, Eddie OSullivan side can now look forward to welcoming England to Lansdowne Road in a fortnight.",['after']
"Scotland will try to give their coach Matt Williams a first Six Nations victory when Italy come to Edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points.","['but', 'when']"
The home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes.,['and']
"A powerful charge from flanker Jason White was carried on by Ali Hogg and when Ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line, Scotland kicked it to touch.","['when', 'and']"
"The Irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed Paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.",['but']
"If that was a paltry reward for their early pressure, Scotland got the try they deserved when Patersons searing break and Andy Craigs pass sent Southwell streaking to the right corner.","['when', 'and']"
"Paterson was off target with the conversion and fly,half Dan Parks then missed a presentable drop,goal attempt.","['then', 'and']"
Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an OGara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead.,['and']
"Stuart Grimes pulled down OKelly at a line,out, Ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set,piece, the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack.",['and']
"OGara added the conversion and a further penalty, after Shane Horgan almost grabbed a second try from OGaras chip to the corner, only for the ball to spill from his hand.","['further', 'and', 'after']"
But Ireland still delivered a hammer blow to Scotlands hopes just before the interval.,"['but', 'still', 'before']"
"OConnell , skipper in the absence of Brian ODriscoll , powered through Parks weak tackle after a free,kick from a scrummage to burrow over.",['after']
"Scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when Ireland flanker Johnny OConnor won another vital turnover, and OGaras basketball pass sent Hickie over in the left corner.","['further', 'when', 'and']"
"OGara converted and then thumped over a 40m penalty to give the visitors a commanding 28,8 advantage.","['then', 'and']"
"Scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half,break from Paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour.","['but', 'before']"
"Stuart Grimes won a line,out and a well,worked move saw Petrie scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner.",['and']
"But it proved a false dawn, and Ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes.","['but', 'and']"
"Peter Stringer and OKelly combined to put giant prop Hayes over in the right corner before replacement Gavin Duffy scorched away on the left, David Humphreys adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.","['and', 'before']"
"Tries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19,5 half,time advantage.",['and']
"Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second,half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory.","['but', 'and']"
"Fly,half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this years tournament.",['as']
"Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes.",['after']
Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half.,['and']
"His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owens long cut,out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run,in.","['but', 'when', 'and']"
"Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.","['but', 'further', 'and']"
"Henson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline.",['rather']
"But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner.","['but', 'and']"
"With the Welsh line,out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors scrum, the home sides forward power brought them back into it.",['and']
But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.,"['but', 'as', 'when', 'and']"
Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy.,"['then', 'and']"
"Henson was also narrowly short with a long,range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.","['but', 'also']"
"Henson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off,loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion.","['when', 'and']"
"Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half,time, built up a head of steam on the resumption.",['before']
"De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19,8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock,on.",['and']
But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour.,"['but', 'before']"
"Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain.","['and', 'after']"
"Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off,loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.","['and', 'before']"
"The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner.","['and', 'after']"
"But after back,to,back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.","['but', 'after']"
But he knows Wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny.,['but']
White is also impressed with the Welsh packs strength in depth.,['also']
"He has played a bit at tight,head but I think his favoured position is loose,head and he is very good, he added.","['but', 'and']"
"The 31,year,old has made a massive contribution to the England and Leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight,head prop in the world.",['and']
"Leicester, who signed White from Bristol when the West Country side were relegated from the Zurich Premiership in the summer of 2003, have also been aided by Whites presence this season.","['when', 'also']"
The Tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the Premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the Heineken Cup.,"['and', 'also']"
"But my form is helped by the people I play with at Leicester , people like Martin Johnson and Graham Rowntree.","['but', 'and']"
Its been a good season so far and to be in the starting XV for the first game of the Six Nations is what every player wants.,"['and', 'so']"
I am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend,['but']
"Injuries have taken their toll and coach Andy Robinson has been deprived of Richard Hill, Jonny Wilkinson, Martin Corry, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood and Stuart Abbott.",['and']
"And with 27 caps and a World Cup winners medal to his name, White is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres Matthew Tait and Jamie Noon.","['as', 'and']"
"I dont know how much experience a tight,head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way","['but', 'or']"
"When I first came into the squad, people like Jason Leonard and Martin Johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.","['when', 'and']"
It gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you.,['when']
I was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good,"['and', 'so']"
White missed the vast majority of last years Six Nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going.,"['and', 'because']"
"And that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red,hot atmosphere in Cardiff.",['and']
"To go down there and hear the shouting and the singing , its one of my favourite places to play.",['and']

"Bell, who featured in the England A side which beat France 30,20 10 days ago, added: I recognise that I got into the England A squad because of injuries.",['because']
And its the same again in getting into the senior squad.,['and']
But now that I have this opportunity I intend to take it fully if selected and play my heart out for my country.,"['but', 'and', 'now that']"

"And the supporters want to see the star players , no disrespect to the other guys , performing on the pitch",['and']
"Ruddock, though, is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue.","['though', 'and']"
"At this stage, theres nothing more [the players] can do in games to impress me further.",['further']

"The world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain Martin Johnson, a lock forward.",['since']
"And former England captain Moore told the BBC: Full,backs are too far away from the action.",['and']
"He added: I just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack , which is, after all, where games usually start and finish","['and', 'after']"
"Moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why England have lost against Wales, France and Ireland in this years tournament.",['and']
Their creativity depends on quick ball and were not getting that.,['and']
"With injuries depriving him of key players like Wilkinson, coach Andy Robinson has given youngsters such as Harry Ellis and Jamie Noon a chance.","['as', 'and']"
And Moore believes the last two games against Italy and Scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further.,"['further', 'and']"
The problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury dont have the requisite experience,"['and', 'because']"
You cant do anything about that but play them.,['but']
"There are players who have been knocking on the door, its time for them to be looked at in these last two games because theres nothing on them.",['because']
We then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby,"['then', 'and', 'next']"
Owen set for skipper role  Wales number eight Michael Owen says replacing Gareth Thomas as Wales captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad.,"['as', 'because']"
"You dream about playing for Wales, but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country",['but']
"Its an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side, but it will be a massive honour","['but', 'so', 'because']"
"Ruddock praised Owens contribution as vice,captain and pack leader in this years wins over England, Italy and France, notably his role in the second,half in Paris following Thomas injury.","['as', 'and']"
"The 22,cap Dragons man says that Thomas will be badly missed, though.",['though']
Gareth is going to be a massive loss because he is a brilliant player and he has done a fantastic job since he has been captain,"['and', 'because', 'since']"
We are going to miss him but the strength of the squad is shown when you have someone like Kevin Morgan to step in.,"['but', 'when']"
"Owen admitted the Grand Slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no,one was getting carried away with the three victories over England, Italy and France.","['but', 'and']"
We have a massive game next up and we are just looking forward to preparing for that.,"['and', 'next']"
Like us they did well in France and were unlucky not to get a win.,['and']
Against Ireland they played fantastically well in the first 15 minutes before falling away.,['before']
Italy aim to rattle England  Italy coach John Kirwan believes his side can upset England as the Six Nations wooden spoon battle hots up.,['as']
"The two sides, both without a win, meet on 12 March at Twickenham and Kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of Englands current slump.",['and']
We have to make sure the England and France games are tough for them.,['and']
That is a big one for us and them and I am sure my players will rise to the occasion,['and']
But Kirwan admits that a lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to London.,"['but', 'before']"
"Roland de Marigny and Luciano Orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to Scotland as Chris Paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much,needed 18,10 victory.","['as', 'and']"
Kirwan said: The kicking was the decisive factor in Scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time.,"['and', 'next']"
But I have a lot of confidence in my players and I am positive we can put everything together against England,"['but', 'and']"
"England, meanwhile, are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee Jonathan Kaplan not gone against them in the second half in Dublin.","['and', 'meanwhile']"
"First Mark Cueto was judged offside as he chased fly,half Charlie Hodgsons kick, and then Kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if Josh Lewsey had touched down after being driven over Irelands line.","['then', 'as', 'and', 'after']"
But centre Jamie Noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats.,['but']
"We went to Dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete, and I think we showed that.",['and']
We have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the Italy game.,['and']
"We are under no illusions that it is going to be easy, but we definitely need a win.",['but']
"England have now equalled an 18,year low of four successive championship defeats, including France in Paris last season, and have lost four in a row under Andy Robinson.",['and']
"His predecessor, Sir Clive Woodward, began his seven,year reign with three defeats and two draws.",['and']
We are going to Scotland for the first away win and nothing else,['and']
"We lost a player like Mauro Bergamasco who has been important for us, but  John  has put together the best team at present, if not ever.",['but']
Teenager Tait picked for England  Newcastles teenage centre Mathew Tait has been named as a centre in Englands team to face Wales in the Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday.,['as']
"Scrum,half Matt Dawson is also recalled, despite been left out of the initial squad after a row over clashing TV and training commitments.","['and', 'also', 'after']"
"Bath lock Danny Grewcock will also start, pending a possible citing.",['also']
England coach Andy Robinson has also awarded Gloucester flanker Andy Hazell his first Six Nations start.,['also']

"Wood , Ireland can win Grand Slam  Former captain Keith Wood believes Ireland can win only their second Grand Slam , and first since 1948 , in this years RBS Six Nations Championship.","['and', 'since']"
"After claiming their first Triple Crown for 19 years last season, Wood tips his former team,mates to go one better.",['after']
Things have been building up over the past few years and I think this is the year for Ireland,['and']
A lot of things are in our favour with England and France at home.,['and']
"Ireland have finished runners,up three times, including last year, since the old Five Nations became Six in 2000, and not finished outside the top three in the past five years.","['and', 'since']"
"Despite being without flanker Keith Gleeson, coach Eddie OSullivan has not had to contend with the sort of casualty lists that have hit England and Scotland in particular prior to the tournament.","['and', 'in particular']"
"For Ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free, and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far","['and', 'so']"
It is going to be tough and we need to take all the luck and opportunities that come our way,['and']
"Irelands last game of the tournament is against Wales in Cardiff , a fixture they have not lost since 1983.",['since']
"But despite their traditional hospitality when the Irish are visiting, Wood believes Wales might end their four,match losing run against England in Cardiff.","['but', 'when']"
So many of the major England players have either retired in the last year or are injured that I think it will be very hard for them down in Cardiff,"['so', 'or']"
"Wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four, so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams","['and', 'so', 'or']"
The Borders flanker has a knee injury and joins Donnie Macfadyen and Allister Hogg on the sidelines.,['and']
Star number eight Simon Taylor will miss at least the first two games after damaging an ankle during his comeback.,['after']
Scott MacLeod  and Jon Petrie  are also doubtful for the opener in Paris on 5 February.,"['and', 'also']"
We will seek further specialist advice in due course to determine just how long Scott may be out for,['further']
"Another potential option, Glasgow flanker Andrew Wilson, has been ruled out for a month after damaging ligaments in both knees against Northampton recently.",['after']
Flanker Jason White and prop Tom Smith have also been suffering from flu and missed this weeks training sessions.,"['and', 'also']"
"We have got plenty of good, young players coming through and we have got to look at the opportunities it represents for them, rather than the negatives","['rather', 'and']"
Williams could now turn to Edinburgh pair Alasdair Strokosch and Simon Cross.,['and']
Leeds Tykes flanker Jon Dunbar also trained with the squad but is still awaiting verification of his eligibility to qualify for Scotland.,"['but', 'still', 'also']"
OSullivan keeps his powder dry  When you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential.,"['when', 'and']"
He decreed after the 2003 World Cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year.,['after']
"It may have annoyed his Scottish, and in particularly Welsh, cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the Celtic League.",['and']
"But, like OSullivan, he was well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it.","['but', 'when', 'and']"
"Bar Keith Gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg, everyone of OSullivans squad is fit, fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this seasons campaign.",['and']
But I doubt whether OSullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players.,['but']
"However, he may look at the overworked and injury,hit England, Wales and France squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight.","['however', 'then', 'and']"
But there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game.,"['but', 'still', 'when', 'and']"
Already Ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season.,['as']
A first Grand Slam since Karl Mullens led the team to a clean sweep in 1948.,['since']
"With England and France visiting Lansdowne Road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down, everything looks perfectly placed.","['and', 'before']"
But in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any Irishman.,['but']
"They were expected to up the ante further for a Grand Slam, only the second in Irelands history.",['further']
Then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary.,"['then', 'and']"
But OSullivans side are very capable of proving a salient point this season.,['but']
"After their first Triple Crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder.","['further', 'and', 'after']"
"OSullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spades .",['and']
"He has some old dogs in his squad, but he will come to this seasons championship with a different box of tricks, and a new verve to succeed.","['but', 'and']"
"Ireland can indeed succeed, but just whisper it.","['but', 'indeed']"
"Williams was expected to miss the match with a disc problem in his neck, but has been making a speedy recovery.",['but']
He will have tests in the next 48 hours and we are pretty optimistic he is getting there,"['and', 'next']"
"It has been frustrating but he is on the mend, he has made good progress",['but']
"Last week Williams, along with fellow flanker Colin Charvis , who is unlikely to play for at least a month while he recovers from a foot injury , was all but ruled out of the Millennium Stadium clash.","['but', 'while']"
"Cardiff Blues flanker Williams, 29, offers considerable experience and if he is declared fit then Ruddock might be tempted to include him in the back row.","['then', 'and', 'if,then']"
"Charvis will be reviewed by the Wales medical staff next Monday, but Davies admitted that there was only an outside chance of him being fit to face France in Wales third championship game on 26 February.","['but', 'next']"
"Wales other injury concern is Pughs fellow Neath,Swansea Ospreys player Sonny Parker, as the centre has a trapped nerve in his neck.",['as']
Sonnys injury is still an issue,['still']
It is still painful and irritable.,"['still', 'and']"
We will run the rule of thumb over him in the next couple of days.,['next']

Jamie Noon is another player on the sidelines after he limped off in the first half against Saracens on Friday with a dead leg.,['after']

"Saints have a weeks training in Portugal next week, while Wales will play England in the opening Six Nations match on 5 February.","['while', 'next']"
Its in the very early stages but it is something we are giving serious consideration to,['but']
"A similar cross,code deal that took Iestyn Harris from Leeds to Cardiff in 2001 did go through, before the talented stand,off returned to the 13,man code with Bradford Bulls.",['before']
"Kel Coslett, who famously moved from Wales to league in the 1960s, is currently Saints football manager, while Clive Griffiths , Wales defensive coach , is a former St Helens player and is thought to be the man behind the latest initiative.","['while', 'and']"

"Sale host Bath in the Powergen Cup on Friday, but the Frenchman has endured a difficult week with six players away on Englands Six Nations training camp.",['but']
Its an important game but weve just the one full session.,['but']
Its the same for everyone but we need to manage it.,['but']
If five players or more are picked for your country they should move the date of the game,['or']
"Unless the authorities agree to make changes, Saint,Andre believes Englands national team will suffer as clubs opt to sign foreigners and retired internationals.","['unless', 'as', 'and']"
Thats not good for the politics of the English team or for English rugby,['or']

But we have to be careful.,['but']
Bath have just been knocked out of Europe and will make it a tough game.,['and']
"It also comes at the end of a very, very difficult week.",['also']
"Sebastien Brunos been with France, Jason White with Scotland and there are six with England, thats eight players plus injuries , 13 players out of a squad of 31.","['plus', 'and']"

"Gloucester have also been caught in a club,versus,country conflict after England sought a second medical opinion on James Simpson,Daniels fitness.","['also', 'after']"
The winger is carrying a shoulder injury and the national team management believe he requires time on the sidelines.,['and']
"As a result he misses the Cherry and Whites quarter,final at home to Bristol.","['as', 'and', 'as a result']"
They obviously want him for international rugby and we want him for club rugby in what is a very important game for us.,['and']
The surgeon who carried out his operation said he was fine for us but England say he is still vulnerable to be damaged again and want him on a full rehab programme,"['but', 'still', 'and']"
"Simpson,Daniel added: Ive said to Nigel I want to be back playing and that means if everything goes well this week, I can target the Worcester game  for a return",['and']
Ruddock backs Yapps credentials  Wales coach Mike Ruddock says John Yapp has what it takes as an international.,['as']
He has been playing with the Blues for two years and has racked up mileage on his playing clock,['and']
"He has international size, is a big, physical lad and a good ball,carrier with a high tackle,count",['and']
"Ruddocks assessment was backed up by Yapps coach at the Blues, former Wales and Lions prop Dai Young.",['and']
Johns been on an upward curve all season and is going from strength to strength,['and']
"His ball carrying gives us good go,forward, he impresses in defence and his work,rate is excellent.",['and']
"To be fair to him hes not quite there with the scrummaging yet, but nobody can fault his effort, commitment and attitude.","['but', 'yet', 'and']"
"Johns a very strong man and is eager for the challenge, if hes pitched in he wont let anyone down.",['and']
"Hes developing quickly, but I hope he isnt pushed too quickly in a way that would hurt his development",['but']
"Ruddock hopes that the selection of Yapp and Dragons lock Ian Gough , out of the international reckoning since falling out with former coach Steve Hansen , will send a message to other players in Wales.","['and', 'since']"
John and Ian have been rewarded for impressing during the Heineken Cup competition,['and']
"Both of them have played well, and we want to send a message out that consistently playing well gets you in the squad.",['and']
"We believe this is an exciting squad representing traditional values of Welsh rugby, and based on the performances in the November internationals.",['and']
"We have strength and experience up front, and well,recognised talent, pace and skill behind.",['and']
The management team just want to get hold of the players and get out on the training pitch at the moment.,['and']

He will be without a host of big names for the Six Nations as the intensity of professional rugby union hits players.,['as']
Injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the English season,['but']
I think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers,['or']
"Robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the Six Nations with the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Will Greenwood injured.",['and']
Rugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago.,['since']
As a result three of the major stakeholders in English rugby have launched an injury audit to find out how players are coping.,"['as', 'as a result']"
"The audit is jointly funded by the Professional Rugby Players Association, the Rugby Football Union and Premier Rugby.",['and']
As far as Robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored.,['as']

"Realising I would be unable to play this season, the club and I agreed to end my contract early",['and']
It allows me to move back to the US and pursue opportunities there and allows the Scarlets to look to the next generation,"['and', 'next']"
"The Scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing Heineken Cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks.","['and', 'after', 'next']"
"We have a deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they wont all be re,signed, its a chance to invigorate the squad",['and']
Im positive about the future of the Scarlets both on and off the field,['and']
"Gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back,five forward Hodges has played at Stradey Park, though.",['though']
He is a real professional and we thank him for the part he has played in our success.,['and']
I am sure he has an enormous contribution to make to the development of rugby in the US and we wish him and his family well,['and']
Hodges described his years at Stradey as the best time of my life,['as']
"Funding cut hits Wales Students  The Wales Students rugby side has become a casualty of the Welsh Rugby Unions reorganisation at youth level.  An amalgamated Under,18 side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on Thursday, against Italy at the Gnoll.",['and']
But that move has seen the WRU decide to end its funding of representative sides such as Wales Students.,"['but', 'as']"
"As a result, traditional international fixtures against England and France in the New Year have been cancelled.","['as', 'and', 'as a result']"
The Welsh Students Rugby Football Union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches.,['or']
The competition provided by the strong English and French teams has enabled the Welsh Students to test themselves in high quality matches.,['and']
"The increasing number of young rugby players entering Higher Education look for the biggest challenge, that is representative rugby, but this year that opportunity will be denied them.",['but']

But I dont believe the rest of the SRU will take this lying down.,['but']
"I think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and, ultimately, it is them who pull the strings.","['and', 'ultimately']"
So I wouldnt be surprised if they reviewed their position.,['so']
And we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the Six Nations Championship.,"['when', 'and']"
"Now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction, and sorrow.",['and']
"It has been quite a year for the Irish, and not just with Eddie OSullivans Triple Crown winning international outfit either.",['and']
Right down through the ranks Irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game.,['and']
"But most of the kudos will go to OSullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first Triple Crown for 29 years, but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record.","['but', 'and', 'also']"
"For the second year in succession they also finished in the runners,up spot in the RBS Six Nations.",['also']

"The 18,12 victory at Lansdowne Road was only their second victory over the Boks after the initial success back in 1965.",['after']
That success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in Blomefontein and Cape Town in the summer.,['and']
"Those two reverses and the 35,17 flop against France, were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months.","['otherwise', 'and']"
"But the big one, of course, was the 19,13 defeat of World Cup champions England on their precious Twickenham turf.",['but']
"The winning try was conceived in OSullivans mind, perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by Girvan Dempsey.",['and']

There was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of Scottish rugby and that is simply not the case.,['and']
"Like all good coaches, you go and ask for an increase.",['and']
But we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that.,['but']
The idea that we are lighting cigars with £20 notes while the rest of Scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue.,['while']
We also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team.,"['also', 'because']"
But let me give you the truth.,['but']
They are currently in camp now and they will have another 21 days in camp before the Six Nations.,"['and', 'before']"

"Never afraid to speak his mind, be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch, or his coach or the media off it, Dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way.",['or']
Dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded England side which became the shock winners of the first Rugby Sevens World Cup in 1993.,['as']
"It took him another two years to graduate to the full England XV, but once there he proved to the manor born.","['but', 'once']"

"Within two years of his debut, Dallaglio was offered the England captains band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. Although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of England team,mate Martin Johnson, he played a massive role in the 2,1 series victory.","['although', 'as', 'and']"
"But after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum, Dallaglios career hit the buffers at speed in 1999.","['but', 'after']"
Worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured England captaincy.,"['though', 'as']"

"As a member of a new,look England side on the long road to World Cup glory , a journey not without mishaps as a succession of Grand Slams opportunities were spurned , Dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again.","['once', 'as']"
Yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short Dallaglios involvement on the Lions tour to Australia.,"['yet', 'as']"
"Rumours began to circulate that his career was over but, in typical Dallaglio style, he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen.",['but']
"One effect of the injury was to rob Dallaglio of much of his pace, but ever the pragmatist, he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre.","['but', 'as']"
"The only player to play every minute of Englands World Cup triumph in Australia, Dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure Englands historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by England supporters.",['and']
"Following Johnsons retirement, Dallaglios career came full circle as Woodward restored him as England captain.",['as']
"While England did not hit the heights in Dallaglios second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post,World Cup Tests, Dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many World Cup stars to live up to expectations.","['as', 'while']"
"Dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of Englands most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.",['as']
"The likes of Matt Dawson, Jonny Wilkinson, Phil Vickery and Hill have all been mentioned as contenders for Dallaglios role as captain.","['as', 'and']"
"But it is as a player that England will really struggle to replace the 32,year,old.","['but', 'as']"
"Although players like Joe Worsley and Chris Jones are more than capable of stepping up, the fact that there is no stand,out candidate speaks volumes about Dallaglios massive influence on English rugby.","['although', 'and']"

Lions blow to World Cup stars  British and Irish Lions coach Clive Woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next years RBS Six Nations Championship.,"['and', 'next']"
"World Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio, Neil Back and Martin Johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summers tour to New Zealand.","['and', 'next']"

"Dallaglio, Back and Johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides.","['but', 'and']"
But Woodward added: The key thing that I want to stress is that I intend to use the Six Nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark.,"['but', 'as', 'and']"
If you are not playing international rugby then its still a step up to Test rugby.,"['then', 'still', 'if,then']"
I think its absolutely critical and with the history of the Lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries,['and']
Woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open.,"['still', 'also']"
"And following the All Blacks impressive displays in Europe in recent weeks, including a 45,6 humiliation of France, Woodward believes the three,test series in New Zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge.",['and']
Their performance in particular against France was simply awesome,['in particular']
"Certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five, but theyre a very powerful unit",['but']
"With his customary thoroughness, Woodward revealed he had taken soundings from Australia coach Eddie Jones and Jake White of South Africa following their tour matches in Britain and Ireland.",['and']
"As a result, Woodward stressed his Lions group might not be dominated by players from England and Ireland and held out hope for the struggling Scots.","['as', 'and', 'as a result']"
Scotlands recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances.,['but']
Eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for Australia and I will take on board their opinions,"['and', 'in particular']"
"And Scotland forward Simon Taylor looks certain to get the call, provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems.",['and']
I took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking Lawrence Dallaglio when he wasnt fit and went on the trip.,"['when', 'and']"
Every player has to be looked at on their own merits and Simon Taylor is an outstanding player and I have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip.,['and']
"I am told he should be back playing by March and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the Lions , and there are other players like Richard Hill in the same boat",['and']

Dallaglio eyeing Lions tour place  Former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio still harbours hopes of a place on the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.,"['still', 'and']"
Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward has made it clear he will pick his squad to tour next summer based on form shown in the Six Nations championship.,['next']
"But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: I assure you I wouldnt let anyone down.","['but', 'earlier']"
I know what it takes and what I have to offer,['and']
Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.,['but']
"The 32,year,old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf,life.",['also']
He said: Ill be in good shape and fresh without another 10 Tests on the clock.,['and']
"If Im fit and playing well, then Im most certainly available.","['then', 'and', 'if,then']"

"The 31,year,old World Cup winning scrum,half has impressed since joining the London side from Northampton this summer on a one,year contract.",['since']
Wasps coach Warren Gatland told the Daily Mirror: We have not yet offered Matt a new contract but we will be doing so.,"['but', 'yet', 'so']"
Im very happy with his contribution and I think hes good enough to play for another couple of years,['and']
Dawson played a vital part in Englands World Cup win last year but has fallen out of favour with new coach Andy Robinson after missing a training session in September.,"['but', 'after']"

I definitely still have ambitions to play for England,['still']
We will have to see what happens after the previous  Tests but when I look at the current squad I definitely feel there is a place there for me,"['but', 'when', 'after']"
"Healey, who has also played both half,back positions and full,back during his career, has reverted to the wing, where he won most of his England caps.","['and', 'also']"
"After recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of September, the 31,year,old is relishing his role in the Tigers revival.",['after']
I had six weeks out but fortunately I have resumed the sort of form I had before,['but']
"Obviously I can play scrum,half, fly,half or full,back at a moments notice.",['or']
But playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where I am not expected and influence things,"['but', 'and']"
"That has been apparent in parts one and two of the Wasps,Leicester trilogy in recent weeks.",['and']
"Then, in the first of their Heineken cup double header last Sunday, Healey slotted in at stand,off and delivered a superb cross,kick for Martin Corry to score the Tigers third try.","['then', 'and']"
"I caught Cozzas eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full, but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score","['but', 'and', 'before']"
It was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game,['and']
There was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in.,['but']
After about 15 minutes I thought we might stride away with it but Wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way,"['but', 'and', 'after']"
The same outcome this Sunday would put Leicester in pole position to top their Heineken pool with a home game against Biarritz and away trip to Calvisano to come.,['and']
But Healey insists the Tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed rugbys version of Rocky II,['but']
There was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done,['but']
"It was the first of a two,leg trip and if we lose at Welford Road it will negate all the positives we can take from result.",['and']

"Im not in any way less ambitious , but I just understand that I should get on with it and enjoy it","['but', 'and']"
"Wilkinson also praised Dave Walder, who has been filling in for him for the Falcons.",['also']
"And he said the experience of starting a game on the bench , as happened against Edinburgh , has made him more appreciative of the role of replacement players.","['as', 'and']"
"But what its done is given me enormous respect and admiration for players who can do that on a regular basis, and Dave Walder has been playing well in the team , so I have to accept it.","['but', 'and', 'so']"
"To be an effective replacement is a skill in itself, and some of our players are fantastic at it.",['and']
"When you start the game youre fully involved, and you react to each second as it goes by , whereas as a replacement you have to watch the game tick by and then almost instantly switch on and join in when everyone else has had time to bed themselves into the match.","['whereas', 'else', 'then', 'as', 'when', 'and']"

"When you are 19 points down in 15 minutes, you are playing catch,up rugby , and that is very difficult, especially away from home","['when', 'and']"

"Marshall set for Leeds move  All Blacks scrum,half Justin Marshall has agreed a two,year contract to play for Leeds from next season.",['next']
"The 31,year,old has a release clause in his New Zealand contract which allows him to move after the 2005 Lions tour.",['after']
It is a really exciting challenge and something new for me,['and']
Leeds rugby director Phil Davies added: Justin is a world class player who will add greatly to this group with his professionalism on and off the field,['and']
"Marshall is the most capped New Zealand back of all time with 77 Tests behind him, but was left at home for the All Blacks European tour in November.",['but']
"He did travel to England to captain the Barbarians against his international team,mates at Twickenham, and is intent on reclaiming his Test spot ahead of the Lions visit in June.",['and']
I enjoy a good challenge and it would be great to face the Lions,['and']
His intended departure later this year comes with the blessing of All Blacks coach Graham Henry.,['later']
"While we never like losing world,class players from our ranks, there is no doubting that he has served New Zealand rugby well over a long period of time",['while']
"Wales international Williams, whose contract with the Welsh region was due to expire in June, has agreed a contract until the end of the season.",['until']
"With Martyn Woods injury likely to keep him out until February, Bath need experienced back,up to Nick Walshe.",['until']
"Said Williams: When this opportunity presented itself, I did not really have to think twice about it",['when']
He lost his Ospreys starting place to New Zealander Jason Spice and has fallen further behind in the pecking order.,"['further', 'and']"
The Welsh region has two outstanding young No 9 prospects in Richie Rees and Rhodri Wells.,['and']
"Bath director of rugby Jack Rowell, though, believes Williams fits the bill perfectly.",['though']
He has been playing regular Heineken Cup and Celtic League rugby and he has a great affection for Bath,['and']
Bath faced with Tindall ultimatum  Mike Tindalls agent has warned Bath they have until next week to improve their contract offer to the England man or risk losing him to a rival club.,"['or', 'until', 'next']"
Dipo Alli says he has received an offer for Tindall which dwarfs Baths deal and that two other clubs want to talk.,['and']
Mike does not want to go into the Six Nations worrying about where he will be playing his club rugby next season,['next']
"Tindall is out of contract at the end of the season but it is understood that Brownsword is unwilling to break the clubs salary structure to accommodate the 26,year,olds demands.",['but']
But Alli insists the player is worth more than Bath have put on the table.,['but']
Mike has been at Bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive,"['but', 'and']"
But Brownsword has to recognise Mikes value and we want to resolve things by the end of next week,"['but', 'and', 'next']"
Tindall wants second opinion  England centre Mike Tindall is to seek a second opinion before having surgery on a foot injury that could force him to miss the entire Six Nations.,['before']
The Bath player was already out of the opener against Wales on 5 February because of a hand problem.,['because']
Before a final decision is made on surgery.,['before']
"England coach Andy Robinson is already without centre Will Greenwood and flanker Richard Hill while fly,half Jonny Wilkinson is certain to miss at least the first two games.","['while', 'and']"
"And Newcastles 18,year,old centre Mathew Tait is set to stand in for Tindall alongside club team,mate Jamie Noon.",['and']
"Meanwhile, Tindall is targeting a return to action before the end of the regular Zurich Premiership season on 30 April.","['meanwhile', 'before']"
He will also aim to be back to full fitness before the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.,"['also', 'before']"
Those are the two questions occupying not just Wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in Paris.,"['but', 'as', 'after']"
"Welsh legend Mervyn Davies, a member of two of three Grand Slam,winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades",['as']
"A crestfallen France coach, Bernard Laporte, simply observed: There was a French half and there was a Welsh half",['and']
"And what a half it was for the Red Dragonhood, transforming a 15,6 half,time deficit into an 18,15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period.",['and']
"But while that passage of play showed the swelling self,belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure, the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this Welsh side.","['but', 'while']"
"That they recovered from a battering in the first half,hour to first stem the tide before half,time, then reverse it on the resumption, was remarkable enough.","['then', 'before']"
"But in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of French pressure in a nail,biting final five minutes, Wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.",['but']
"In international rugby, any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day, but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis.",['but']
"England suffered some infamous Six Nations disappointments en route to World Cup glory, the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered.","['when', 'ultimately']"
Wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light.,['before']
But the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline.,"['but', 'previously']"
"Ten of the 22 on duty on Saturday were also involved when Wales were trounced 33,5 in Paris two years ago.","['when', 'also']"
"But since they threw off the shackles against New Zealand in the 2003 World Cup, Wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.","['but', 'since']"
The confidence in the squad has been building and building since the World Cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class,"['and', 'since']"
"The likes of Michael Owen, Gethin Jenkins, Dwayne Peel and Gavin Henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summers Lions tour to New Zealand.",['and']
"And players like Stephen Jones, Martyn Williams, Shane Williams and Gareth Thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve.",['and']
"Jones, after his superb man,of,the,match display, observed that we are a very happy camp now",['after']
"Ruddock and Thomas can take much of the credit for that, ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred Welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad.",['and']
"The  joie de vivre  so evident in that magical second,half spell in Paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.","['also', 'so']"
"Similarly, Wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches, and that forward power, mental toughness and good decision,making under pressure are equally important.","['similarly', 'and']"
"So on to Murrayfield, where Wales have not won on their last three visits.",['so']
"While the hype in the Principality will go into overdrive, the players will set about the task of beating Scotland.",['while']
"Only then , with the visit of Ireland to finish , can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s, and writing their own names into Welsh legend.","['then', 'and']"
Wales silent on Grand Slam talk  Rhys Williams says Wales are still not thinking of winning the Grand Slam despite a third Six Nations win.,['still']
We all realise how difficult a task it is to go up to Scotland and beat them.,['and']
Weve come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and well worry about Ireland hopefully after weve beaten Scotland,"['and', 'so', 'after']"
"With captain Gareth Thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb, Williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far.",['so']
"Kevin Morgan is probably favourite to replace Thomas at full,back, leaving Williams and Hal Luscombe to battle for the right wing berth.",['and']
"A hamstring injury denied Luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start, but the Dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to Murrayfield on 13 March.",['but']
"Hooker Robin McBryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in Paris, but centre Sonny Parker and flanker Colin Charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection.","['but', 'and', 'after']"
Said Wales assistant coach Scott Johnson: Theyve worked through the weekend and the reports are a bit more positive.,['and']
So were getting a couple back and that adds to the depth of the squad,"['and', 'so']"
"Matt Williams side has shown little in attack, but Johnson insisted the Scots will be difficult opposition to break down.",['but']
Italy are really brave opposition and sometimes its very hard to win,['and']
So an ugly win can be just as effective as a 30 or 40 point victory.,"['as', 'so', 'or']"
Scotland are a hard side and very underrated so were not taking anything for granted.,"['and', 'so']"
Thats my job and weve got to make sure were focused,['and']
Sculthorpe wants Lions captaincy  Paul Sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed Andy Farrell as Great Britain skipper if the Wigan star does switch codes to rugby union.,['as']
"Sculthorpe was vice,captain in the Tri,Nations, and took the St Helens captaincy from Chris Joynt last year.",['and']
Andy would be a hard act to follow but its something Im confident of being up to,['but']
Its a short career and you have to make of it what you can,['and']
Sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play.,['also']
"Sean Long, Sculthorpes Saints and Lions team,mate, has expressed doubts about his international future I think Seans situation is to do with the sheer number of games were playing",['and']
"The way hes looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby, then hes willing to do that.","['then', 'if,then']"
Were playing 42 weeks of the year and its too much.,['and']
A lot of the niggly injuries that Ive suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time,['because']
"St Helens have been strongly linked with a move for brilliant young forward Sonny Bill Williams, and Sculthorpe said he would love the 19,year,old to come to Knowsley Road.",['and']
"Hes a great player , a big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence, but who is also very skilful","['but', 'also']"
"But you want the best players in your team, and hes certainly one of the best players in the world.","['but', 'and']"
We and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage,"['else', 'still', 'and', 'next']"
"At the moment, there are still a lot of unknowns about Andy Farrell, not least his medical situation.",['still']
"Farrell, who has had persistent knee problems, had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months.",['and']
"Leicester and Saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing Farrell if he decides to move to the 15,man game.",['and']
Im sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre,['and']
"At this club, the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a ready,made replacement",['and']
"Leicester and Saracens are leading the chase for the player, but Lindsay told the BBC it was not yet a done deal.","['but', 'yet', 'and']"
"As well as the Rugby Football Union, the league, the individual club and the England coaching team have a say, so its not a quick decision","['as', 'as well', 'and', 'so']"
"Hes given us 12 years service so if he wants to go, wed support him",['so']
The prospect of Farrell switching codes has been the main talking point of the Super League season so far.,['so']
It came as a bolt out of the blue to us,['as']
"But hes a very loyal friend to the club, so theres no question that hes deserting us.","['but', 'so']"
"Although the move would be a lucrative one for both Farrell and Wigan, Lindsay said money was not a motivating factor for the club.","['although', 'and']"
"The money side of things hasnt been concluded, but its not the point for Wigan",['but']
"Even if we did have it, under the salary cap we cant spend a penny of it anyway , wed rather have the player",['rather']
Lindsay also said he understood why rugby union was so interested in signing up Farrell.,"['also', 'so']"
Itd be a great loss for us but a great boost for them,['but']
Hes been at the top for so long and has demonstrated so many attributes that you need to make it in a tough contact sport.,"['and', 'so']"
"Athletes like him , Ellery Hanley and Martin Johnson , dont come along very often.",['and']
England given tough Sevens draw  England will have to negotiate their way through a tough draw if they are to win the Rugby World Cup Sevens in Hong Kong next month.,['next']
"The second seeds have been drawn against Samoa, France, Italy, Georgia and Chinese Taipei.",['and']
"The top two sides in each pool qualify but England could face 2001 winners New Zealand in the quarter,finals if they stumble against Samoa.",['but']
Scotland and Ireland are in Pool A together with the All Blacks.,['and']
England won the first event of the International Rugby Board World Sevens series in Dubai but have slipped to fourth in the table after failing to build on that victory.,"['but', 'after']"
"However, they beat Samoa in the recent Los Angeles Sevens before losing to Argentina in the semi,finals.","['however', 'before']"
England have the ability and determination to win this World Cup and create sporting history by being the only nation to hold both the 15s and Sevens World Cups at the same time,['and']
"England have a fantastic record in Hong Kong and have won there the last three years, but the World Cup is on a different level. Every pool contains teams who have caused upsets before and we will have to work hard to ensure we progress from our group.","['but', 'and', 'before']"
"We have not performed consistently to our true potential so far in the IRB Sevens which has been disappointing , but we can only look forward","['but', 'so']"
England won the first Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1993 with a side that included the likes of Lawrence Dallaglio and Matt Dawson.,['and']
"In 1997 and 2001, England lost in the quarter,finals.",['and']
"Wales hails new superstar  One game into his Six Nations career, and Gavin Henson is already a Welsh legend.",['and']
"And if his natural self,assurance and swagger is shared by his Wales team,mates, then a full,blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the Valleys.","['then', 'and', 'if,then']"
"The Red Dragonhood subdued the Red Rose Army in most areas of the field, but Hensons stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others.",['but']
"And his defence was a major feature of the match, his principal victim poor old, or rather young, Mathew Tait.","['rather', 'and', 'or']"
"The England centre will have spent his 19th birthday on Sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up,ended not just once, but twice, by Hensons all,enveloping tackles.","['but', 'once']"
"The second time, after the interval, single,handedly lifted the record Millennium Stadium crowd at a time when England were starting to show menace.","['when', 'after']"
"His kicking game also prospered, particularly when he moved to full,back for 10 minutes either side of half,time when his captain Gareth Thomas was in the sin,bin.","['when', 'also']"
One huge clearance from Taits kick sent England retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half.,['while']
"Henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for Shane Williams narrowly missed its target, a precise cross,kick forcing Jamie Noon to fumble the ball into touch.",['also']
"He also had a hand in the games only try, finished superbly by Williams, and might have scored himself on the half,hour as he glided into space, only to be scragged by Tait.","['as', 'and', 'also']"
Henson was twice repelled as Wales laid siege to the English line after Charlie Hodgsons penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time.,"['as', 'after']"
"But he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din, and the outcome of the match fell to him.","['but', 'as', 'and']"
"It was out of Steves range but I looked at Gavin, and he gave me a reassuring nod","['but', 'and']"
"Henson, surveying his date with destiny, positively relished the responsibility, and the chance to make himself a hero.",['and']
"Without further ado, he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of English dominance and 12 years of waiting in Cardiff.","['further', 'and']"
I knew I was going to get it before I even took the kick,['before']
I have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasnt a problem,['so']
"There were still four minutes for Wales to hold out, and the frenzy was such that Henson could not even hear Jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away.","['still', 'and']"
"But it was Wales who finished the game on the attack, almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax.",['but']
"And, thanks to Henson, Wales did.",['and']
"Sydney to host north v south game  Sydney will host a northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in June or July, the Australian Rugby Union  said on Wednesday.",['or']
The date is yet to be decided but the most likely venue is Sydneys Olympic Stadium.,"['but', 'yet']"
ARU chief executive Gary Flowers said the world cricket charity match in Melbourne earlier this month had inspired the ARU.,['earlier']
"We still need to discuss the options with the IRB , the Lions and our SANZAR  partners, but June or July is seen as a better option than March to ensure we have the cream of southern hemisphere rugby available","['but', 'as', 'still', 'and', 'or']"
"Tri,Nations rivals Australia, New Zealand and South Africa would feature prominently in a southern team against a northern side comprised of Six Nations teams France, Ireland, England, Wales, Italy and Scotland.",['and']
"Coach Clive Woodwards Lions squad will tour New Zealand in June and July, including Tests on 25 June, 2 and 9 July.",['and']
"Celts savour Grand Slam prospect  The Six Nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and Wales and Ireland rather than traditional big guns France and England face a potential Grand Slam play,off in three weeks time.","['rather', 'and']"
"But before that game in Cardiff, Wales must get past Scotland at Murrayfield, while Ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial French.","['but', 'while', 'before']"
"No,one knows what mood France will be in at Lansdowne Road on 12 March , sublime, as in the first half against Wales, or ridiculous, like in the same period against England at Twickenham.","['as', 'or']"
But how the mighty have fallen.,['but']
England sat on rugbys summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 Grand Slam winners.,"['as', 'and']"
But they have lost nine of their 14 matches since that heady night in Sydney.,"['but', 'since']"
"And they face the ignominy of what could amount to a Wooden Spoon play,off against Italy in a fortnight.",['and']
England are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain Richard Hill was dumped in favour of Mike Harrison after three straight losses in 1987.,"['after', 'since']"
And he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team.,['and']
"And they won only two games, against Scotland and Italy, in 2004.",['and']
"Wales most recent championship title was in 1994, and their last Grand Slam success came in 1978 in the era of Gareth Edwards, Phil Bennett, JPR Williams et al.",['and']
But Welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age.,['but']
"After several false dawns, coach Mike Ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations.","['and', 'after']"
"The fresh verve is inspired by skipper Gareth Thomas, now out with a broken thumb, accurate kicking from either fly,half Stephen Jones or centre Gavin Henson, a rampant Martyn Williams leading the way up front, and exciting runners in the guise of Henson and Shane Williams.","['and', 'either,or', 'or']"
"Ireland coach Eddie OSullivan and captain Brian ODriscoll have got their side buzzing too, and they are close to shedding the nearly,men tag that has dogged them for the past few years.",['and']
"The men from the Emerald Isle have been Six Nations runners,up for the past two years, to France and England.",['and']
But they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a Grand Slam in 1948.,"['but', 'and', 'since']"
"As for Scotland, they have struggled this decade and the 2004 Wooden Spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999.","['as', 'and', 'since']"
"Italy continue the elusive search for their first Six Nations away win, and can still only account for the scalps of Scotland  and Wales since joining the elite in 2000.","['still', 'and', 'since']"
"Coach John Kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the Azzurri, but is lacking in raw materials.","['but', 'and']"
"Brilliant one minute, inept the next.",['next']
But the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in Dublin and end up winning the title through the back door.,"['but', 'and']"
"Ireland, though, have won three times in their last five meetings.",['though']
"But given that Ireland have beaten Wales in four of their last five meetings, the Welsh legions are likely to be behind Les Bleus on 12 March.",['but']
"Ireland win eclipses refereeing errors  The International Rugby Board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly,up.","['when', 'and']"
"It may have to go the whole way and have NFL,style video cameras all over the field, or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles.","['and', 'or']"
Sundays explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road was a good example as Ireland took another step towards their first Grand Slam since 1948.,"['as', 'since']"
"The game was as exciting as it comes, with a much,improved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way.",['as']
"There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19,13 victory, but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sports blazers",['but']
Referee Jonathan Kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece.,"['and', 'in particular']"
"After all, he has no public recourse to criticism.",['after']
"It was the same for Simon McDowell, the touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France.",['after']
"As far as England were concerned, there were queries over Mark Cuetos first half,effort when he went over in the corner from a Charlie Hodgson kick.","['as', 'when']"
England coach Andy Robinson referred to a similar case at Ravenhill in January when Ulster were playing Gloucester in the Heineken Cup.,['when']
But you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies.,['but']
Perhaps Robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey was driven over the Irish line near the end.,['when']
Lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control.,['and']
"However, one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny OConnor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown.","['however', 'and']"
"But in rugby, everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes.",['but']
The referee also missed Englands Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan OGara off the ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to the line.,['also']
"But there were many more, and one should not take away from those.","['but', 'and']"
"Brian ODriscolls winning try was as well,conceived as they come, while Charlie Hodgsons brilliant kicking display was another highlight.","['as', 'while', 'as well']"
And Ronan OGaras tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component.,"['and', 'also']"
But the defining moments came with Ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes.,['but']
Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on.,['and']
"He gobbled up Cueto from another Hodgson cross,field kick, then regained his feet to stop Lewsey from scoring a certain try.",['then']
"England had turned Ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating.","['then', 'and']"
"Unfortunately he ran into OConnell who hit him hard , very hard , and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover.","['then', 'and']"
"It may be tries that win games, but it is defence that wins championships.",['but']
"A second,half try from captain Brian ODriscoll and 14 points from Ronan OGara kept Ireland on track for their first Grand Slam since 1948.","['and', 'since']"
England scored first through Martin Corry but had tries from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey disallowed.,"['but', 'and']"
Andy Robinsons men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 World Cup final.,['since']
The defeat also heralded Englands worst run in the championship since 1987.,"['also', 'since']"
"Ireland last won the title, then the Five Nations, in 1985, but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with Wales.","['but', 'then']"
"And Eddie OSullivans side banished the ghosts of 2003 when England were rampant 42,6 victors in claiming the Grand Slam at Lansdowne Road.","['when', 'and']"
"In front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in Dublin, Ireland tore into the white,shirted visitors from the kick,off and made their intentions clear when OGara landed a fourth,minute drop,goal.","['but', 'when', 'and']"
England took their time to settle but their first real venture into Irelands half produced a simple score for Corry.,['but']
"The number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the Irish line, racing 25 yards to touch down.",['and']
"England fly,half Charlie Hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately OGara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalties in quick succession.",['but']
"England were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes, and Hodgson, the villain at Twickenham, coolly bisected the posts.","['and', 'after']"
"The first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking, but it was Ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs.","['but', 'and']"
"A series of probes led by the talismanic ODriscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but Ireland chose to kick for touch.",['but']
"As the interval approached, wing Josh Lewsey was the catalyst for Englands most promising attack.",['as']
"The Wasps star raced up his touchline and Hodgsons cross,kick put in Mark Cueto for an apparent score, but the Sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker.","['but', 'and']"
England began the second half well and had Ireland pinned in their own half.,['and']
"But another English indiscretion on a rare Irish break,out awarded OGara a kick at goal, which he missed.",['but']
"Englands pressure continued, and a wave of attacks saw centre Jamie Noon dragged down yards from the line before Hodgson landed a drop,goal.","['and', 'before']"
"The lead was shortlived, however.",['however']
"Ireland raced upfield, deft handling from the backs, including a clever dummy from Geordan Murphy on Hodgson, ending with ODriscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts.",['and']
"OGara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgsons cross,kick was fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line.","['when', 'and']"
"Anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky,high, but OGara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop,goal attempt.",['but']
"But despite one near miss with the pack over the line , not checked on the TV replay by referee Jonathan Kaplan , England were unable to pull off a face,saving win.",['but']
Ireland next face France at Lansdowne Road in two weeks time before the potential title decider against Wales in Cardiff.,"['before', 'next']"

"Fuming Robinson blasts officials  England coach Andy Robinson said he was livid after his side were denied two tries in Sundays 19,13 Six Nations loss to Ireland in Dublin.",['after']
"Scotland 18,10 Italy  Six Chris Paterson penalties gave Scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against Italy at Murrayfield.",['but']
"Coach Matt Williams side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6,3 at the break.","['but', 'and']"
"Paterson slotted four more second,half penalties and Scotland were denied a try when wing Sean Lamonts touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass.","['when', 'and']"
"Scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3,0 lead through the boot of full,back Paterson.",['and']
But the more powerful Azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.,['but']
"A series of drives into Scottish territory set up a penalty attempt, missed by full,back Roland De Marigny, and a wayward drop,goal effort from Luciano Orquera.",['and']
"Scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes Italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a De Marigny penalty.","['but', 'after']"
"Italy were offered another penalty when Scottish flanker Simon Taylor was offside but the left,footed De Marigny pushed his kick wide.","['but', 'when']"
Scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the Italian half and snatched three points from Paterson when an Italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.,"['when', 'and', 'finally']"
"As the half wore on, both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties, and the period fizzled out with Scotland numerically, if not psychologically, on top.","['as', 'and']"
"Italys De Marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long,range kick shaved the right upright.","['but', 'after']"
And Scotland capitalised with a third Paterson penalty on 50 minutes.,['and']
"Williams side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and, after a couple of probing attacks, Paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.","['and', 'after']"
"With the pendulum of possession swinging towards Scotland, Lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from Paterson.","['but', 'after']"
"But John Kirwans men had the last laugh when Gordon Ross attempted clearance was charged down and Masi pounced for the try, converted by De Marigny.","['but', 'when', 'and']"
OConnell rejects Lions rumours  Ireland and Munster lock Paul OConnell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.,['and']
"OConnell is rumoured to be among the front,runners for the job, but says he is totally focused on Sundays Six Nations crunch clash with England.",['but']
"The Lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk, nothing more.",['and']
I just ignore it and get on with my job.,['and']
He added: The only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think.,['after']

"The book, being serialised in the Guardian newspaper, says on 13 March Lord Goldsmith met then Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan.","['then', 'and']"
After that Downing Street proceeded to set out his [Lord Goldsmiths] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 March,"['then', 'after']"
"These revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates , even on an issue as important as peace and war.","['as', 'and']"

"We would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done, to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election","['however', 'and']"

"The Greater London Act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list, their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party",['and']
"He said Mr Hulme,Cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was UKIP who were not being true to the electorate.",['and']

And that is more important to them than national security.,['and']
"He preferred to state that, as with other issues like ID cards, the governments immediate instinct was authoritarian.",['as']
"As is his habit nowadays, the prime minister was less rough with Mr Kennedy than he had been with Mr Howard , he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the Lib Dems have, once again, just missed the point.","['once', 'as']"

Later Birminghams Sion Simon even went so far as to suggest the Tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now.,"['as', 'so', 'later']"
"But can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away , an announcement coming in the week beginning 4 April for an election on 5 May is where the big money is in the Commons.",['but']
And perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment.,['and']
Lord Goldsmith said Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan played no part in drafting the answer.,['and']
"He added the answer represented his view that the war was legal, but was not a summary of his advice to the PM.",['but']
"In a statement, Lord Goldsmith said: I was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer",['and']

No other minister or official was involved in any way,['or']
"He suggested the claim that Lord Falconer and Lady Morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis,transcription of his evidence to the Butler Inquiry into pre,war intelligence.",['and']
"As I have always made clear, I set out in the answer my own genuinely held, independent view that military action was lawful under the existing  Security Council resolutions",['as']
"The attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did","['but', 'as']"
"Earlier, Tony Blair dismissed questions about the attorney generals advice, and said his Parliamentary statement had been a fair summary of his opinion.","['and', 'earlier']"
Thats what he  said and thats what I say.,['and']
"He has dealt with this time and time and time again, Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street.",['and']
He refused to answer further questions on the issue.,['further']
"On the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential, Tory MP Michael Mates, who is a member of the Commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the Butler inquiry, told the BBC: That, as a general rule, is right, but its not an absolute rule","['but', 'as', 'and']"
"He said there had been other occasions when advice had been published, most recently regarding Prince Charless marriage plans.",['when']
"The government could not pick and choose when to use the convention, he said.","['when', 'and']"
"The claims about Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgans involvement were made in a book published this week by Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blairs Matrix Chambers.",['and']
He also says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.,['also']
"A short statement about Lord Goldsmiths position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 , just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action , did not suggest this.",['before']
"Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.","['as', 'earlier']"
"She said the full advice should have been attached, according to the ministerial code, and demanded a Lords inquiry into the matter.",['and']
The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.,"['still', 'and']"
Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said Lord Goldsmiths statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues.,['still']
Many Labour MPs have since indicated that the attorney generals answer played a pivotal role in their willingness to back the conflict.,['since']
"Another peer meanwhile, Lord Skidelsky, said not to publish the full legal opinion would strengthen the suspicion that the the original text was doctored for public consumption, in exactly the same way as the notorious intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction","['as', 'meanwhile']"

Tory expert denies defeat warning  The Conservatives campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned Michael Howard the party could not win the next general election.,['next']

It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event.,['since']
Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.,"['instead', 'as']"
"For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton.",['and']

The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.,['before']

"Labour later took the image off its website, saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members.",['later']
The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: 2+2=5,['and']
"It showed Mr Howard and Mr Letwin , who are both Jewish , as flying pigs.","['as', 'and']"
"Mr Howard did not comment on the anti,Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday.",['when']
"Instead, he pointed to how Tony Blair had in 1997 complained about personalised abusive campaigning",['instead']
"Jewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e,mails from Jewish Chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image.",['but']
"Shylock and Fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries,old prejudice",['and']
"Whatever the idea is, I think its a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning","['and', 'or']"
"Labour MP Louise Ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti,Semitic when they only challenged Tory economic policies.","['but', 'when']"
"The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued.",['as']
"Concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but I would emphasise that if you see the posters, the common theme.","['but', 'and']"
A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the partys website was not affected by the row.,['later']
This has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss,"['and', 'so', 'before']"
"But a Conservative spokeswoman said: This poster campaign , which was offensive to many people , was a big misjudgement by Labours campaign team",['but']
"Mr Milburn said he appreciated peoples concerns, but insisted that what they were was anti,Tory and not in any way, shape or form anti,Semitic","['but', 'and', 'or']"
Labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs.,['and']
"A row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict Michael Howard, who is Jewish, as Fagin, and as a flying pig, amid claims they were anti,Semitic. The posters were labelled a big misjudgement by the Conservatives who said Labours first shot in the election has badly backfired","['as', 'and', 'after']"
"The partys four new designs, launched on Tuesday, steer clear of the Fagin or flying pig images, but make clear that Labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the Tory leader personally, with reminders of his record in office.","['but', 'or']"
"In the Commons, Tory spokesman Mr Lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded MPs that Labour chairman Ian McCartney last year described shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin as a 21st Century Fagin","['as', 'and']"
"Given the outrage that that smear caused then, how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti,Semitism","['then', 'and']"
"Mr Milburn replied that they were not anti,Semitic. What they were was anti,Tory and I make no apologies at all for making clear to the British public exactly what the Conservative plans would mean",['and']
I fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the Labour Party website,"['indeed', 'and']"
The Fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off Labours website on Monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin holding a blackboard reading 2+2=5.,"['and', 'after']"

"She says she will fight on her record as a hard,working constituency MP",['as']
"Mr Kilroy,Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth.",['after']
"Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970.","['until', 'since']"
"On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties lies and spin",['and']
He said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration and promised a firm but fair policy on immigration.,"['but', 'and']"
"Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.","['but', 'and', 'next']"
Immigration to be election issue  Immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time.,['and']
Both Labour and the Tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns.,['and']
That was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue.,"['and', 'also']"
"But it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or, alternatively, running scared of addressing the problem.","['but', 'or', 'alternatively']"
But this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies.,['but']
"The Tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration, with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the UK.",['and']
Labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the Tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue.,['but']
"Now Home Secretary Charles Clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry, and to kick out more failed asylum seekers.",['and']
"That has been attacked by the Tories as too little, too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the UK.","['as', 'and']"
"The Liberal Democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a Europe,wide policy on immigration.",['but']
"But, while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue, there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before.","['but', 'as', 'while', 'and', 'before']"
"My concern is that, whilst the Labour Party and the Conservative Party will take a constructive approach to the debate, right,wing political parties, picking up on statements like `burden to Britain will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty",['and']
"It is precisely that concern , and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far rights racist agenda , that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue.",['and']
The challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap.,"['while', 'and', 'also']"

"The Liberal Democrats say in the northern cities, the race is between them and Labour, while in southern seats , particularly the south west , it is between them and the Tories.","['while', 'and']"
"Asked whether it was realistic to assume the Liberal Democrats could win the general election, he said: Theres no limit to the ambitions we have as a party.",['as']
"But we have got to be responsible, we have got to be credible, we have got to demonstrate to people that we are up to that task",['but']
"Mr Kennedy said the British public felt let down by Labour on issues from Iraq to top,up fees and the Conservatives were not asking the critical questions",['and']
And he said people were highly sceptical about Labour and Conservative promises on tax.,['and']
But he brushed off Labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the Tories in by the back door,['but']
"If you look at the four previous parliamentary by,elections, the Liberal Democrats have demonstrated that, not only can we leapfrog the Conservatives where we start in a third place position, but we can go on to defeat the government.",['but']
"The problem, according to Mr Lane, is not continuing divisions over Iraq, foundation hospitals or tuition fees, or even voter apathy, but Mr Blair himself.","['but', 'or']"

But for every Brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of Mr Blair.,['but']
"Stephen Douglas, 26, from Wales, said after the PMs speech on Sunday: I think it was a bit of a turning point, given the roasting he has had on some issues.",['after']
"Malcolm Shipley, of Shipley, said it was as if he is coming round to the right approach again","['as', 'as if']"
"She had just emerged from a Q&A session, in which Mr Blair , tieless and supremely at ease , answered questions posed via the partys website.",['and']
"A party of councillors from Nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with Mr Blairs leadership , and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever.","['as', 'and']"
"It might sound great, but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and I think that is the greater problem than Iraq","['but', 'and']"
"And even Mr Blairs most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing , he is a master of the sort of glossy, high,profile campaigning that has become Labours hallmark, epitomised by Fridays whistle,stop tour of marginal seats.",['and']
"A group of shop stewards from the Swan Hunter shipyard, who said they were facing redundancy, could barely suppress their anger at Mr Blairs failure to, as they saw it, shake off his Tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the North East.","['as', 'and']"
"They were also scathing about the alleged benefits of showpiece projects such as conference venue Sage Centre, heralded by John Prescott and others this weekend as a symbol of Labours success in urban regeneration.","['as', 'and', 'also']"
It is no good having the Sage or Baltic if you havent got the money for the entrance fee,['or']
"But when asked about Mr Blairs bravura performance on Friday, the men agreed he was brilliant","['but', 'when']"
And they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the Labour message come election time.,['and']
There is no complacency as far as I can see in the Labour Party.,['as']
"Mr Telford agreed, but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked What has Labour done for the North East","['but', 'when']"
"Every activist I spoke to said they were proud of what they believed Labour had achieved in their local communities , the new hospitals and schools, the better life chances for young people.",['and']

Campaign cold calls questioned  Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls,"['still', 'and']"
"The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing , for instance by asking about peoples voting intentions.",['for instance']
The information commissioners office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept.,['but']
"Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run,up to the general election.","['as', 'before']"
"But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service  lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls.","['but', 'and']"
Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications.,['and']
The rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies.,['as']
But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS.,"['but', 'and']"
A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising.,"['when', 'or']"
But that did not happen for voter identification calls.,['but']
"When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not","['when', 'and']"
So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service,['so']
"He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again.",['and']
A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers.,['when']
She said: We do apply TPS but in line with the law.,['but']
Assistant information commissioner Phil Jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them.,['as']
But classic market research,['but']
"If a party is calling someone who is registered on TPS and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned",['and']
"If a party rings a person who is registered on TPS to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them, the party may well be in breach of the regulations.",['and']
"In summary, whether a party calling TPS registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed",['and']
"Earlier, Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor wrote to the watchdog saying: The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal",['earlier']
I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases,"['and', 'therefore']"
Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.,"['and', 'so', 'later']"
Vincent Cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment.,"['and', 'or']"
He wants to see proper health checks when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection.,"['when', 'so']"
"Were economic conditions to deteriorate at all, large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit",['because']
"Mr Cable said the governments Consumer Credit Bill would target some of the extreme problems such as loan sharking, but ministers had been a bit complacent about the wider issue of debt levels.","['but', 'as']"
He said much of the payment protection currently available was extremely expensive and there were lots of exclusions,['and']
Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the UK aimed at persuading voters his is the real opposition,['meanwhile']
"Mr Kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats, where his party is hoping to make gains from the Conservatives, and urban areas traditionally associated with Labour.",['and']
And he brushed off Labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the Tories in by the back door,['and']
"The partys scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust, as a way of getting onto the housing ladder.",['as']
The Lib Dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites.,['also']
"Labour has already announced plans to help first,time buyers and the Tories would extend right,to,buy schemes.",['and']
"All the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run,up to the election after a survey suggested first,time buyers could not afford a home in 92% of UK towns.",['after']
"Party leader Charles Kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government.","['because', 'or']"
"People would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land, he added.","['and', 'also']"
They would spend about 30% of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property.,['and']
"When they moved house, they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share.",['when']
It would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account.,"['also', 'so']"
"Mr Kennedy said: Mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually, investing only as much as they can afford","['as', 'much as']"
There are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities.,['also']
"Under the plan, councils secure deals with developers where they keep a 1% share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market.",['so']
"Instead, they are sold at build cost to people who the local council decides have local needs.",['instead']
"But the plans involve changing the VAT system, which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings.",['but']
"They claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder, but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market",['but']
"Labour has said it will allow 300,000 council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes.",['and']
"However, as usual, the Lib Dems proposals are completely uncosted","['however', 'as']"
Mr Hill said he also asked whether the Lib Dems would match Labours promise to spend £42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010.,"['and', 'also']"
Charles Kennedy is pledging a maternity income guarantee and a pension system based on years of residence rather than national insurance payments.,"['rather', 'and']"
"He also thinks women will back plans to end university tuition fees and for free long,term care for the elderly.","['and', 'also']"
Both Labour and the Conservatives have said they also plan to boost pensions and to improve childcare support.,"['and', 'also']"
"Under the package, new mothers would be offered minimum guaranteed maternity pay of £170 a week for the first six months after the birth of their first child.",['after']
"Mr Kennedy also believes the partys plans to use the money saved from not introducing illiberal ID cards to boost police numbers by 10,000 would appeal to women too.",['also']
"The policies are not new announcements, but the way they are structured as a package to appeal to women is.","['but', 'as']"
Mr Kennedy also points to the fact that 40% of the partys candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women.,"['also', 'or']"
"The baby and his wife Sarah would be priority number one even if it arrived in the middle of the election campaign, he said.",['and']
"A party spokesman said it was courting female votes because they tended to vote more than men and are believed to be more considered and open,minded in deciding who they vote for.","['and', 'because']"
Labours deputy minister for women Jacqui Smith accused the Lib Dems of offering false promises to women and said their sums did not add up.,['and']
"She said: These proposals would increase the costs to the public purse drastically year on year, and hard working families will pay dearly, through either increased taxes or reduced spending on public services","['and', 'or']"
"The Labour party has committed itself to universal, affordable and flexible childcare for parents of all 3 to 14 year,olds, including childcare centred on schools to be available from 8am to 6pm.",['and']
"In September, Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave, higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers, if Labour won a third term.",['and']
"The Conservatives are yet to unveil their manifesto plans for childcare but said in November they would increase maternity pay and pay the child tax credit in cash to parents to spend as they like, on a nanny, au pair or even a family member, such as a grandparent, acting as a carer.","['but', 'yet', 'as', 'and', 'or']"
They were also consulting on making childcare costs tax deductible.,['also']
Kennedy questions trust of Blair  Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said voters now have a fundamental lack of trust of Tony Blair as prime minister.,['as']
"Questions from callers, a studio audience and the shows presenter covered Lib Dem tax plans, anti,terror laws and immigration.",['and']
Mr Kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in Parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of British politics.,['and']
"1983 was when I was first elected as an MP , so Tony Blair, Michael Howard and myself were all class of 83 , and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition","['as', 'when', 'and', 'so']"
"We dont actually hear the argument any longer: Lib Dems, good people, reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here , its a wasted vote.",['but']
You dont hear that because the evidence of peoples senses demonstrates that it isnt a wasted vote,['because']
But he said Mr Blair had lost the trust of the British people.,['but']
There is a fundamental lack of trust in Tony Blair as prime minister and in his government,"['as', 'and']"
"What weve got to do as a party , what Ive got to do as a leader of this party , is to convey to people that what you see is what you get",['as']
"Mr Kennedy also used his TV appearance to defend his partys plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than £100,000, saying it would apply to just 1% of the population.",['also']
"He said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top,up fees, introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax.",['and']
Mr Blair has already spent a day with Five and Michael Howard is booked for a similar session.,['and']
Brown outlines third term vision  Gordon Brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of New Labours next general election bid.,['next']
"The chancellor has previously planned the partys election strategy but this time the role will be filled by Alan Milburn , a key ally of Tony Blair.","['but', 'previously']"
"The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labours campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.",['and']
"As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, Labours ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment, not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities","['but', 'as', 'and']"
BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Browns article was a warning shot to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process.,['and']
"It was, as always, coded and careful.","['as', 'and']"
The prime minister was asked about Mr Browns article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4s Today programme.,"['when', 'and']"
Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellors role would be central,"['but', 'yet']"
Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was in part because of Mr Browns management of the economy.,"['and', 'because']"
And he pledged childcare would be a centrepiece of Labours manifesto.,['and']
"He also predicted the next general election will be a tough, tough fight for New Labour.","['also', 'next']"
But the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 May.,['but']
"Mr Blair said he was taking nothing for granted ahead of the vote , warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labours majority instead of hoping for an outright win.",['instead']
Labours Cunningham to stand down  Veteran Labour MP and former Cabinet minister Jack Cunningham has said he will stand down at the next election.,"['and', 'next']"
"One of the few Blair,era ministers to serve under Jim Callaghan, he was given the agriculture portfolio when Labour regained power in 1997.",['when']
He has represented the constituency now known as Copeland since 1970.,"['as', 'since']"
"Mr Blair said he was a huge figure in Labour and a valued, personal friend",['and']
"During Labours long period in opposition, Mr Cunningham held a number of shadow roles including foreign affairs, the environment and as trade spokesman.","['as', 'and']"
As agriculture minister he caused controversy when he decided to ban beef on the bone in the wake of fears over BSE.,"['as', 'when']"
"He quit the government in 1999 and in recent years has served as the chairman of the all,party committee on Lords reform and has been a loyal supporter of the government from the backbenches.","['as', 'and']"
Michael Howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned Tory tax cuts.,['finally']
"Should he win the next general election, he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes , although he still will not say which or how.","['although', 'still', 'or', 'next']"
"This was the pre,election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters, he believes, will warm to.",['and']
"At its simplest, it is saying: Vote Tory and you can have it both ways",['and']
"Not only would his government stick to Labour spending plans on core public services, including health and education, it would increase spending on defence, police and pensions.",['and']
"And even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.","['still', 'and', 'after']"
"All the money would come from its £35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy, waste and the civil service.",['and']
"Of that, £23 billion would go on spending plans, with £8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by Gordon Brown, and the rest going in tax cuts.",['and']
"Neither Mr Howard nor Mr Letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash, although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely.","['although', 'neither,nor', 'nor']"
"Ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the Tory party are urging Mr Howard to announce something more eye,catching before the election.","['although', 'and', 'or', 'before']"
"As the Tory leader declared, the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between Labour and the Tories.","['as', 'and']"
"At this election, people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less",['and']
It is a move back towards an almost traditional Tory message which previously suggested Labour was the party of tax rises and the Conservatives the party of tax cuts.,"['and', 'previously']"
"The extension of that, however, was that Labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the Tories were the cutters.","['however', 'as', 'while', 'also']"
He insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into Downing Street.,['before']
"Labour, needless to say, claim his planned £35bn efficiency savings simply dont add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy.",['and']
"One of New Labours greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters, business and the City that it could be trusted to run the economy.","['and', 'before']"
"So far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third New Labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances.","['but', 'so', 'either,or', 'or']"
"Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day.","['meanwhile', 'earlier']"
"So, Mr Howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor.","['and', 'so', 'finally']"
"And, while other issues like the Iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign, it is likely , and the prime minister probably hopes , that the economy will be the deciding factor.","['while', 'and']"
"The government intends to legislate, when parliamentary time allows, to lower the age",['when']
"Even if the move does go ahead it is unlikely it will be in place before the next general election, widely predicted for May.","['before', 'next']"
The Votes at 16 alliance said it was a good thing to engage people by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective.,['but']
Currently candidates in both local and national votes must be 21 while the voting age is 18.,"['while', 'and']"
That is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place.,"['but', 'because']"
"But the youngest is understood to have been Tory Edward Turnour, who won the 1904 Horsham by,election aged 21 and 144 days and served in Parliament for 47 continuous years.","['but', 'and']"
The commission found the most common approach around the world is for the voting age to be the same as the candidacy age.,['as']
"The slogan Britain forward not back  is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky , its always there but we mostly stop noticing.","['but', 'as']"
"Forward is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and, along with not back, is set against a mushy pea green background.",['and']
"As one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared, it was all very post modern, or something.","['as', 'or']"
"And, coincidentally, the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so,called Fagin posters which caused Tory protests have not been sacked but, as election supremo Alan Milburn declared, are doing a very good job","['but', 'as', 'and', 'so']"
"Mr Milburn, in the latest in his series of pre,election,campaign campaigning, explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe Labour and Tony Blair are the future while Michael Howard and the Tories would take the country backwards.","['while', 'and']"
Not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days,"['as', 'before']"
It would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between Labour and the Tories.,"['and', 'because']"
"Nobody, he claimed, could picture Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy walking up Downing Street the day after polling.",['after']
"They could, however, picture Michael Howard or, of course, Tony Blair doing it.","['however', 'or']"
So it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the oppositions policies and past record.,"['and', 'so']"
"And Tony Blair would be in the very front line of that campaign, he said.",['and']
"Between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of London than in it but in Britain, not overseas","['but', 'and']"
"So, lets get on with it then.","['then', 'so']"
"The Lib Dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while Labour criticised extravagant Tory promises on policing.",['while']
"Responding to the plans, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained.",['and']
"Outlining his crime manifesto, Mr Howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates.",['and']
"The trouble is, and its no reflection on the people who are on the police authority , they are good people , but hardly anyone knows who they are","['but', 'and']"
Mr Howard said the authorities were not providing the local accountability that we want to see and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.,['and']
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the plan was dangerous and could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials,['and']
Mr Oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a minimum policing guarantee with their chief constables.,['but']
"A Labour Party spokesman criticised Michael Howards record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary.",['when']
Other Tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.,['and']
"It would then be up to Tony Blair, Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy to decide whether to take part, the non,partisan charity said.","['then', 'and']"
Lord Holmes proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch US President George W Bush slug it out verbally with his Democratic challenger John Kerry.,['after']
"If Mr Blair did not want to take part, the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why, Lord Holme said.","['and', 'or']"
"What makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although Mr Howard and Mr Kennedy have said they would welcome a debate, no,one has heard directly from the prime minister","['although', 'and']"
"It has been left to nudges and winks, hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that Mr Blair doesnt want one, but we havent heard from the prime minister himself","['but', 'and']"
"Opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes, he said.",['and']
"Lord Holme argued that as part of their public service obligations, broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead as soon as the election is called.","['as soon as', 'as']"
"An independent third,party body such as the Hansard Society or Electoral Commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public, he said.","['as', 'and', 'so', 'or']"
It would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse,['or']
"If the prime ministers reported position is true and he does want to take part, he would then be obliged to say why publicly.","['then', 'and', 'if,then']"
"The broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well,understood reasons, or going ahead with an empty chair.","['then', 'and', 'or']"
The Hansard Society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001.,['and']
"Last month he said: We answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons I have given before, the answer is no","['and', 'before']"
"Chancellor rallies Labour voters  Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the stakes are too high to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.","['or', 'next']"

"Laying into the Conservatives record in government he said: I give you this promise , with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.",['and']
Never again Tory boom and bust.,['and']
"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more",['and']
"Turning to the economy, the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.",['and']
He also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty.,"['and', 'also']"

Instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past.,['instead']
"There will be a simple choice at the election , value for money and lower taxes with the Conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown","['and', 'or']"
Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable warned the picture was not as rosy as Mr Brown would like to portray it.,['as']
"Gordon Brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy, a system which subjects millions of people to means testing, and a system of taxation which is extremely complex.",['and']
"Also in Gateshead, the prime minister took questions sent in by e,mail, text message and telephone as part of Labours attempt to engage the public in their campaign.","['as', 'and', 'also']"
"Mr Blair told the audience he believed the Iraq war would have made Britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible, but not before the job was done.","['but', 'as soon as', 'as', 'and', 'before']"
He also said he wanted to carry on as PM because I still think that there are big changes our country needs,"['as', 'still', 'also', 'because']"

What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and its going to be fear and smear,['and']
"The Tory co,chairman attacked Labours six new pledges as vacuous and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver.","['as', 'and']"

Blair joins school sailing trip  The prime minister has donned a life jacket and joined school children in a sailing dinghy as he sought to sell his partys education policies.,"['as', 'and']"
"Tony Blair sailed across the lake in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, while on a visit with Education Secretary Ruth Kelly to back school outings.",['while']

The Conservatives and Lib Dems both say his pledges are worthless,['and']
"Mr Blair, looking a little windswept, joined two girls from St Egwins Middle School in Evesham and an instructor for a trip in the Wayfarer dinghy, closely followed by a boat full of photographers.",['and']
Afterwards he said outdoor activities were beneficial for children but accepted that lots of teachers now worried about taking part for fear of being sued if something went wrong.,['but']
What were doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action,['so']
When you are doing these types of activities youve got to exercise some common sense there obviously.,['when']
You cant have a situation where parents or teachers end up being worried that theyre going to be subject to all sorts of legal action if they take children sailing or doing outdoor activity that is actually good for the kids and good for their health and their character,"['and', 'or']"

It aims to improve discipline in schools by adopting a zero tolerance approach to disruption of classes and introducing fixed penalty notices for truants.,['and']
Labour also plans to give head teachers at groups of local schools control over funding for units to handle disruptive pupils.,['also']

Former Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell has described the episode as a bit of a disaster as it meant the launch of Labours election manifesto received little coverage.,['as']
"But it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive, not least because it coincided with John Prescotts even more direct contact , when he punched an egg,throwing protester.","['but', 'as', 'when', 'because']"

There is an issue of credibility and trust,['and']
We cannot have a continuation of a situation where the chancellor sets his own tests and then marks them.,"['then', 'and']"
Mr Cable also accused the chancellor of ducking tough choices.,['also']
He argued: There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt.,['and']
But they have not been confronted.,['but']
Mr Brown confirmed he was setting aside another £520m for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.,['and']
"Mr Cable compared that new cost with the £500m needed for Britains role in the entire first Gulf War , when 80% of the bill had been met through help from European and Arab nations.","['when', 'and']"
He suggested keeping British troops in Iraq could cost another £1bn with the government also planning to spend at least £3bn for identity cards.,['also']
"Instead, what was needed was simple and fair taxation rather than the complete mess produced by Mr Browns endless tinkering.","['instead', 'rather', 'and']"
"And one,and,a,half million hard working families were paying 60% marginal tax rates.",['and']
Mr Brown earmarked £1bn to help keep down council tax rises next year.,['next']
But the Lib Dem spokesman questioned whether that money was being found from cuts to education and health.,"['but', 'and']"

"In a speech at Edinburghs Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term",['next']

"In his pre,Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year.","['and', 'next']"
"Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% , and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated.","['and', 'or']"
"Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK.","['in fact', 'and']"
In order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election,"['after', 'next']"
But he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises.,['but']
"The central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in England keep next years council tax rises below 5%, in what is likely to be a general election year.",['next']

Mr Raynsford also plans to make savings of £100m by making changes to local government pensions schemes.,['also']
These would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early.,['and']
He insisted the changes were very modest and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring very early,['and']

"Mr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule , with a margin to spare",['as']
He also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Partys chances of winning.,['also']
Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising.,"['still', 'after']"
"If the MPC  were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy , and Im not predicting that they will , I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour","['and', 'because', 'before']"

I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,['and']
"Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.","['but', 'yet']"
"As Tory spokesman Oliver Letwin said , any chancellor would use his pre,election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners, wouldnt he.",['as']
"And everyone does, indeed, expect Gordon Brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 May.","['indeed', 'and', 'before']"
There will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways.,['or']
But Mr Brown will stun Westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters faces and make them more inclined to back Labour in the election.,"['but', 'and']"
And there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this weeks Budget.,['and']
"The aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core Labour voters in the fold, while ensuring the middle England voters who gave Tony Blair two election victories dont desert him at the third poll.",['while']
"And, needless to say, there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the Budget will have on Mr Browns own ambitions to replace Mr Blair as prime minister at some point after a third win.","['as', 'and', 'after']"
"But there is a shadow hanging over this pre,election performance , in the shape of £11 billion or thereabouts.","['but', 'or']"
"That is the size of the financial black hole the Tories, backed by some independent forecasters, believe Mr Brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election.",['after']
"It was immediately denied, but the Tories remain suspicious, claiming that, as Mr Letwin said, if the money does not come from there, where will it come from.","['but', 'as']"
"Mr Brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election, should Labour win.","['and', 'after']"
"Previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong, he will argue, while suggesting that only by sticking with him can Britain continue to have a sound economy, low unemployment and high public spending.","['while', 'and']"
"The opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound, increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.",['and']
"The Liberal Democrats will also promise to run a sound economy, but based on increased taxes to fund spending and, amongst other things, abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax.","['but', 'and', 'also']"
And there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in Whitehall and beyond to fund their policies.,['and']
But probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years.,"['but', 'and']"
And it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election.,"['still', 'and']"
Budget to set scene for election  Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labours bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT.,['when']
"He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates.",['and']
"The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000.",['and']
"But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means,testing under Labour.","['but', 'and']"
"Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre,election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.",['but']
"Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000.",['and']
"Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased.","['then', 'while', 'since']"
"Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the governments tax take.","['as', 'as a result']"
"The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a classic Labour stealth tax",['also']
"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn",['after']
"But Mr Browns former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties.","['but', 'next']"
"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years , that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way","['but', 'and']"
"SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing.",['and']
Plaid Cymrus economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.,['and']
"Brown comes out shooting  Labour may have abolished hunting , but that didnt stop Chancellor Gordon Brown using his Budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties core election foxes.",['but']
"Specifically, it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families.","['specifically', 'as', 'and']"
"In a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre,election boost everyone had been predicting.",['and']
"So if you are a couple with children, a pensioner, a patient or a youngster, there was something pulled from Mr Browns red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a New Labour government.","['so', 'or']"
"The announcements brought great cheers from his own MPs who are now in full,on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps.",['and']
"They obviously believed he had done that for them and, coincidentally, given his own image as a prime minister,in,waiting another little boost.","['as', 'and']"
"Labour MPs, for example, will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive , a lovely Old Labour word , this chancellor really is.",['for example']
"But Gordon Brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win Labour an historic third term, his demeanour remained quiet, confident and reassuring.","['but', 'as', 'and']"
"Prudence made an appearance, albeit towards the end of his address, as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to Britain and which, he claimed, would be thrown away by anyone else.","['else', 'as', 'and']"
"According to the opposition parties, however, it is all one big con trick.",['however']
"As always, they accused him of glossing over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finances which, they claim, would ensure tax increases after the election.","['as', 'after']"
He did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the 2001 election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax.,['after']
"As Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy claimed, for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless.","['as', 'and']"
"Tory leader Michael Howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re,casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the Treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use.",['as']
"As ever, there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellors red book, which sets out the fine detail of his budget, in an attempt to spot the flaws.",['as']
In particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal.,['in particular']
And in Labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister Gordon Brown will make at some point after the next election.,"['and', 'after', 'next']"
"How was it right that the poorest 20% of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest 20%, the Lib Dem leader asked.","['as', 'still']"
"Speaking in the Commons after Mr Brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last Budget before the general election, Mr Kennedy acknowledged that the UK was one of the most successful economies in the world.","['before', 'after']"
But he criticised both the chancellor and the Tories for failing to address the ticking bomb of council tax revaluation.,"['but', 'and']"
He said the recent experience of Wales indicated seven million households in England would pay significantly more after revaluation.,['after']
"The Lib Dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than £450 a year, with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off.",['and']
"On pensions, Mr Kennedy said it was a scandal that the system discriminated against women who had missed making National Insurance payments when they were having children.",['when']
"Mr Kennedy added his partys priorities of free long,term care for the elderly, abolishing top,up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50% income tax to those earning more than £100,000 per annum.",['and']
The chancellor went on to put up National Insurance contributions after the election.,['after']
And they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election,"['when', 'and', 'before', 'after']"
"Howard attacks pay later Budget  Tory leader Michael Howard has dismissed Gordon Browns Budget as vote now, pay later spending plans.","['as', 'later']"
"The simple fact was that under a new Labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole, Mr Howard said.",['after']
"Mr Browns Budget was not about what was good for the country, but all about the interests of the Labour party",['but']
He went on to accuse Mr Brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other.,['while']
He urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging millions of people in to the net to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax.,['and']
"We can all see the sweeteners, but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard,working families that are inevitable if Labour wins",['but']
He also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems Britain faced.,"['and', 'also']"
"Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste , to get people to vote now and pay later",['and']
"You now propose to borrow, over the next six years, no less than £168 billion, so much for prudence.","['so', 'next']"
"There was nothing in the Budget that would put more police on the streets, make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools.","['and', 'or']"
"People would face a clear choice at the election, either more waste and higher taxes under Labour or lower taxes and value for money with the Conservatives","['and', 'or']"
"Thats what this election is going to be all about and I say bring it on, he concluded, to loud Tory cheering.",['and']
"Whitehall cuts ahead of target  Thousands of civil service jobs have already been cut or moved out of London as part of a major cost,cutting drive.","['as', 'or']"

"He plans to axe 104,000 jobs to free up money for education, health, defence, housing and overseas aid.",['and']
Unions oppose the plans but Mr Brown said £2bn savings had already been made and more jobs had been cut than had been expected at this stage.,"['but', 'and']"
"A further 200 jobs at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have been earmarked to be cut.","['further', 'and']"

"Mark Serwotka, the leader of the Public and Commercial Services Union said: In last years budget we had the day of the long knifes as the chancellor kicked off the crude game of who could cut the most civil service jobs between the government and the Tories.","['as', 'and']"
"There was a time when the only worry thousands of hard working civil and public servants had on budget day was whether petrol or taxes would go up, nowadays the worry is whether they will have a job by the end of it","['when', 'and', 'or']"
"He said Mr Brown had made welcome announcements on closing tax loopholes and extending the New Deal, while cutting the very people who deliver them","['while', 'and']"

Brown calls for £5.5bn Aids fund  Gordon Brown has called on rich nations to fund a £5.5bn  plan to fight the Aids epidemic and find a vaccine.,['and']
"Doubling the £400m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives, Mr Brown said on Thursday.",['and']
"I believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat, cure and eradicate the worlds deadliest disease of today , and today the worlds least curable disease , HIV/Aids , will rightly earn the title the great generation",['and']
At least $10 billion per annum  is needed to address the HIV/Aids crisis in low and middle income countries.,['and']
"Existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic. The UKs proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important , increasing world aid flows by over $50 billion .",['so']
"Mr Brown also said he had agreed with the Italian finance minister Domenico Siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world,wide sharing and co,ordination of research into the disease.","['and', 'also']"
"Currently the private sector was only spending £60m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting, Mr Brown said.",['and']
"He called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at a cost of $20 each, thereby boosting the market for inoculations.",['thereby']
"This would be a large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms, Mr Brown added.",['and']
"More must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with HIV/Aids and their families, he said.","['and', 'also']"
But Aid charity Actionaid criticised Mr Browns preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on G8 nations to fund HIV/Aids treatments.,"['but', 'and']"
"The charitys head of HIV/Aids in Britain, Simon Wright said: While encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an HIV vaccine is important, a failure to provide any funding for HIV treatments condemns a generation of people to death.",['while']

He will visit an HIV/Aids orphanage in Tanzania and a womens credit union in Mozambique before chairing a meeting of the Commission for Africa in Cape Town.,"['and', 'before']"

"Adults must be paid at least £5.05 an hour, up from £4.85, while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid £4.25.",['while']
The recommendations came from the Low Pay Commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999.,['since']

A further increase in the adult rate to £5.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for October 2006.,['further']

Conservative leader Michael Howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not seek to disturb the increase.,['and']

"This was only 2 years ago and I was getting paid £2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe its about time 16 , 21 year olds got a fair wage!","['as', 'and']"
We must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad.,"['and', 'therefore']"
Still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it.,"['still', 'and', 'or']"
An easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together.,"['as', 'and']"
However for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage I would simply ask them: Would you be happy to work for less than £5.05 an hour,['however']
I cant believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage!,['so']
Its about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldnt go a miss either.,['and']
It is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders.,"['also', 'so']"

"I feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people cant afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life.","['but', 'on the other hand', 'as', 'and']"
Its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.,"['but', 'rather', 'as']"
"We all remember Michael Howards protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced , funny how hes gone quiet on that one!",['when']
Jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in.,['since']

"If your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe its not being run properly and if it folds, a better,run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!","['except', 'then', 'and', 'so']"

"And here he was again, moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause, to make a personal, ad,libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory.","['as', 'and']"

"James McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens.",['and']
800m hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane.,['and']
"The injury,plagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter.","['but', 'after']"

"But I want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember , or forget , for athletics.","['but', 'or']"
Winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality.,"['then', 'because', 'if,then']"
It was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her Athens story.,['and']
The victory for the British mens 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the Games.,['but']
"I think the four of them , Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis,Francis , knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal.",['and']
The lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.,"['when', 'so']"

What happened to Paula in Athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well.,"['as', 'as well', 'and']"
"Dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise.","['but', 'later']"
That was her heart and not her head reacting.,['and']
Paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.,['and']
"Things like niggling injuries, not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her.",['and']
I think she came to the start line in Athens physically and emotionally drained.,['and']
"And if even the smallest thing doesnt feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall.","['when', 'and']"
"The positive thing to take from Paulas Olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people , including me.","['and', 'so']"
"Purely as a race, Paulas victory in the New York Marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling.",['as']
"It was so nip,and,tuck between her and Kenyas Susan Chepkemei and you dont usually get that kind of excitement in marathons.","['and', 'so']"
"It was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, Paula showed real bouncebackability","['also', 'because']"
And it was a bit of a rarity for me too because I genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.,"['and', 'because']"
Kelly and the 4x100m boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the British team.,['and']
And thats where things begin to look even gloomier for British athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in Italy.,"['as', 'and']"
Dani Barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for Team GB.,['and']
The thing is if we dont have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesnt look good for the Beijing Olympics and beyond.,"['then', 'and', 'if,then']"
"In the absence of Paula, we tend to think of the event as something of an African preserve.",['as']
So to have an Australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.,"['and', 'so']"
I just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.,['so']
"Having said that, Im always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore.","['when', 'and', 'because']"
And one of the positive things to come out of Balco is people are starting to blow the whistle.,['and']
We need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats.,['and']
"As regards the case against Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, well suspicions have been hanging over Kenteris for a while.","['as', 'while', 'and']"
The bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.,"['then', 'because', 'if,then']"
"Collins banned in landmark case  Sprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight,year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport .",['after']
Americas former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use.,['or']
The sprinter has consistently protested her innocence but the CAS has upheld USADAs findings.,"['but', 'as']"
"The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and THG",['and']
Collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time,['and']
So far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the Balco doping scandal.,['so']
World record holder Tim Montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the USADA. His hearing before the CSA has been rescheduled for June next year.,"['also', 'before', 'after', 'next']"
USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that.,['further']
"The CAS panels decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of USADAs ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of US athletes that compete drug,free",['as']
The USADA has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into Balco rather than test results.,['rather']

The trial is expected to open next March.,['next']
"Jones, who says she is innocent, could lose all her Olympic medals after Conte said he gave her performance,enhancing drugs before the Sydney Olympics.","['before', 'after']"
"But Rogge said it was too early to speculate about that, hoping only that the truth will emerge",['but']
Any decision on the medals would be taken by the IOCs executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that Olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the Games closing.,['and']
"The Sydney Olympics ended more than four years ago, but World Anti,Doping Agency chief Dick Pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now.","['but', 'because']"
"In a statement released through her attorney Rich Nichols, Jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared.",['and']
Victor Contes allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward,"['as', 'and']"
"Conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory, inconsistent statements",['and']
Johnson accuses British sprinters  Former Olympic champion Michael Johnson has accused Britains top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition.,['and']
Athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride,['and']
"However, Linford Christie countered: Its easy to criticise when you havent gone through the system here","['however', 'when']"
Johnson was involved in a verbal spat with Britains Darren Campbell earlier this year.,['earlier']
The American had cast doubt on Campbells claims he had torn a hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the Olympic 100m and 200m finals.,['and']
And the American remains highly critical of aspects of British sprinting.,['and']
The only time you see British sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other,"['as', 'when', 'or']"
Their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top British sprinter.,['and']
"Speaking at an elite coaches conference in Birmingham, Johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in Britain, it had not necessarily reaped the rewards.","['although', 'also']"
Those who arent funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging.,"['and', 'because']"
So when they get to the top they are more appreciative,"['when', 'so']"
Radcliffe proves doubters wrong  This wont go down as one of the greatest marathons of Paulas career.,['as']
"But as a test of character, it was the toughest race shes ever taken part in.","['but', 'as']"
"A win in the New York marathon doesnt make up for the disappointment of Athens in any shape or form, but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year.","['but', 'and', 'or', 'next']"
She can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future.,['and']
"And although two hours 23 minutes wasnt one of Paulas best times, it wasnt far off the record on a difficult course.","['although', 'and']"
"I was speaking to Paula in the lead,up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no,win situation.",['and']
"And if she lost, people would say her career was over.",['and']
"And a lot of people were wondering what would happen if Paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in Athens.","['as', 'and']"
But that was never on the cards.,['but']
"She might have been beaten, but she would have kept running.",['but']
"The reasons she was forced to pull out in Athens , the niggling injuries, her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions , werent at play here.",['and']
"After all, if youre the best in the world at an event, youll always have expectations of winning.",['after']
"Now Paula will take part in the Run London 10km race in London at the end of the year, have a well,earned rest over Christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.","['and', 'next']"
If she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years,['and']
"Asked if there was a timescale as to what medals could be taken, Pound said: That is not an issue at all",['as']
"However, under International Olympic Committee  rules, athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event.",['however']
"Jones, who won five medals at the 2000 Olympics, denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over Contes allegations.",['and']
Pound continued: If she has indeed taken drugs it is going to be a big disappointment for a lot of people,['indeed']
"Back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m.","['then', 'and']"
"Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, Are you strong enough to finish",['and']
"The question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high,profile and emotional circumstances.","['and', 'after']"
Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens.,"['as', 'as well']"
If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness.,['and']
"For much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York , win or lose.","['and', 'or']"
"But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has,been and her profile will suffer.","['but', 'and']"
"And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.","['as', 'further', 'as well', 'and']"
Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,['and']
"Radcliffes best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30,year,old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York.",['and']
Shes just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it,['and']
"Radcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as impulsive but she is certain to have a tick,list of personal goals.","['but', 'as']"
"Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption.","['but', 'as', 'still', 'and']"
Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful.,['but']
The course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world.,['as']
"It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs final reserves.",['also']
Radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon.,"['and', 'before', 'after']"
Its suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,"['and', 'after']"
"But that is only for long,term health and fitness.","['but', 'and']"
When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly.,"['still', 'when', 'and']"
So physically it is possible for Paula.,['so']
Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe.,['also']
"And that just isnt going to be there in New York, thats been taken out of the equation",['and']
"And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York.",['and']
How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,"['as', 'or']"
And Yelling says: I think this will probably make Paula,['and']
I think it will drive her on and shell come out of it a better athlete,['and']

But an independent tribunal ruled that the duo had not been informed that they needed to attend a drugs test in Athens.,['but']
"However, their former coach Christos Tzekos was banned for four years by the tribunal.",['however']
Kenteris and Thanou still have to face trial on charges brought separately by Greek prosecutors of missing the drugs tests and faking a motorcycle accident to avoid testing at the Athens Games.,"['separately', 'still', 'and']"
"Greek sprinters wont run again  The careers of sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are over, says the boss of the organisation that cleared them of missing a drugs test.",['and']
Greek Athletics Federation boss Vassilli Sevastis told the countrys parliament: I believe Kenteris and Thanou wont race again.,['and']
"Athletics bosses are considering its reponse to the ruling, while the athletes face a trial in a Greek court.",['while']
Greek prosecutors have brought spearate charges of missing the drugs test and faking a motorcycle accident.,['and']
"Speaking to the Greek Parliament on Tuesday, Sevastis said that the evidence sent by the International Olympic Committee and athletics governing body the IAAF was not strong enough for the Greek Association to find the sprinters guilty.",['and']
We were given the task of getting the snake out if its hole but we were not given any evidence to do it with,['but']
So how can you as a Greek with your hand on your heart try the athletes,"['as', 'so']"
The athletes are technically free to compete while the IAAF reviews its response to the decision to clear Kenteris and Thanou.,"['while', 'and']"
But Sevastis said: It does not matter if they are found guilty at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the current decision is reversed,"['but', 'and']"
IAAF will contest Greek decision  The International Association of Athletics Federations will appeal against the acquittal of Greek athletes Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou.,['and']
Now the IAAF will lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport  and has suspended both athletes.,['and']
The statement continued: Both athletes cases will be refered to arbitration before the CAS.,['before']
The decision in both cases will be final and binding.,['and']
Segas said the IAAF appeal was expected and understandable,['and']
"Kenteris, who won Olympic 200m gold at the 2000 Olympics, and Thanou were suspended by the IAAF last December after failing to take routine drugs tests before the Athens Games.","['and', 'before', 'after']"
"However, the independent tribunal overturned those bans, clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti,doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics.","['however', 'and', 'before']"
Kenteris lawyer Gregory Ioannidis described the IAAFs decision as not unexpected but told BBC Sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly.,"['but', 'as', 'so']"
The IAAFs timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions,['and']
"The IAAF has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements, testimonies, the closing speeches of defence counsel..",['yet']
We have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth,['and']
Kenteris and Thanou dramatically withdrew from last summers Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August.,"['and', 'after']"

"Kenteris, 31, and Thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drug tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti,doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics.","['and', 'before']"
They withdrew from the Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August.,['after']
"Kenteriss lawyer, Gregory Ioannidis, said: The decision means Mr Kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career.",['and']
He has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in January.,"['further', 'and']"
This evidence shows Mr Kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the International Olympic Committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one.,['so']
He has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures,['and']
But the IAAF said it was very surprised by the verdict.,['but']
"Johnson too strong for GB runners  Britains Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling were no match for Benita Johnson in the 51st Cross International Zornotza in Amorebieta, Spain.",['and']

"Tulu has won the Boston, London and Tokyo Marathons, as well as the world 10,000m title in 2001.","['as', 'as well', 'and']"

Yelling clinched the womens European cross country title last month and Pavey followed up with bronze.,['and']
Keska helped the mens team to overall third place while Hickey finished in 10th place on his junior debut.,"['while', 'overall']"

Thanou desperate to make return  Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou says she is eager to compete again after being cleared of missing a drugs test by an independent Greek tribunal.,['after']
"Thanou, 30, was provisionally suspended for missing a test before the Olympics, but the decision was overturned.","['but', 'before']"
The IAAF will decide if we can compete again in Greece and abroad,['and']
"Thanou, 30, and her compatriot Kostas Kenteris were provisionally suspended by the IAAF in December for missing three drugs tests.",['and']
But an independent tribunal of the Greek Athletics Federation overturned the provisional ban on 18 March.,['but']
"However, Dick Pound, the chairman of the World Anti,Doping Authority, has said he will appeal against the decision if the IAAF does not.",['however']
And Thanou and Kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident.,"['then', 'and', 'later']"

"Then, on cue, Lewis,Francis ran a textbook final leg, holding off Maurice Greene to bring Team GB home in 38.07 seconds , just one hundredth of a second ahead of their rivals.",['then']
Winning the gold medal was the highlight of my athletics career so far,['so']
"This award is not just for me, but for all my friends, family and the people who have helped me to get to this level in my sport","['but', 'and']"
"Of course this award is very special, but for me nothing will ever take away winning an Olympic gold medal.",['but']
Life since then has been fantastic. Campbell agreed receiving the honour capped off what has been a difficult year for the sprinter.,"['then', 'since']"
I think the MBE is important because the people closest to me know my journey,['because']
It gives me a lot of joy and satisfaction to know the stuff you do for your country does mean something,['and']

The hearing in June will focus on the admissibility of evidence gathered during police raids on Balcos offices and Andersons home.,['and']
Conte and Anderson were not arrested at that point but federal agents did obtain statements from them.,"['but', 'and']"
The defence are expected to challenge the legality of those interviews and if Ilston agrees she could could reject all the evidence from the raids.,['and']
"Balco has been accused by the United States Anti,Doping Agency  of being the source of the banned steroid THG and modafinil.",['and']

I would like to see Dwain come back and compete again.,['and']
Even though he made a mistake he understands what he did and should be given a chance once more,"['though', 'once', 'and']"
"He says so himself in a matter,of,fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk.","['as', 'so', 'before']"
"There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car.","['as', 'after']"
I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,['and']
But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know.,['but']
"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully Id be able to race","['though', 'but', 'as', 'and', 'as though']"

"Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamies back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home , something he is now very relieved about.","['but', 'until']"
The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae.,['or']
That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again.,['and']
But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me.,"['but', 'when']"
The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic. Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.,"['and', 'after']"
He then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January.,"['then', 'finally', 'until']"
Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery,['finally']
Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and its very effective.,['and']
A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and Im fairly incapacitated today as a result.,"['as', 'and', 'as a result']"
Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years.,['also']

"Jamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice,daily physio sessions and pool,work.","['and', 'in addition']"
Lying down for three and a half months didnt really help with the strength.,['and']
Im doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work.,['and']
Im also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles.,"['and', 'also']"
But training is just part of the process of getting back.,['but']
"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up.",['and']
Its a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts.,['and']

Training in Wales and getting advice from Linford Christie is broadening my mind,['and']

But Mr Pande said that if the critics were to see the film they would not protest against it and would not insist on its withdrawal.,"['but', 'and']"
She apparently goes to him for help but he falls in love with her.,['but']

For any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well,['as']

Kapranos described his appearance on Wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming Brits performance.,['as']
Its going to be great to go down but I have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight,['but']
Also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels.,['also']
We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. The only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.,['and']
The government has enough problems funding schools and health services.,['and']

"However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician.",['however']
"The government shouldnt fund music , it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.",['and']
I think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise.,['and']
The equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people.,['and']
"However, I do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.","['however', 'and']"
I do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies!,"['but', 'also']"
"They generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for!","['and', 'ultimately', 'or']"
If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great deal.,"['then', 'if,then']"
"Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff.",['and']

"Franz Ferdinand, who were shortlisted in five categories, won best rock act and best British group, an award they dedicated to late DJ John Peel. But they missed out on best British live act, which went to Muse.","['but', 'and']"
Keane won best British album and breakthrough act.,['and']
"McFly won the best pop act prize, and Gwen Stefani picked up the best international female artist award.",['and']
"Best British male artist winner Mike Skinner , aka The Streets , does not usually attend award ceremonies, but the Birmingham hip,hop artist performed his hit Dry Your Eyes at the ceremony.",['but']
"However, he did not collect his prize.",['however']

Keane frontman Tom Chaplin thanked fans for enduring rubbish gigs after they won the British breakthrough act prize.,['after']

"Scissor Sisters, Franz Ferdinand, Keane, Joss Stone and McFly were all in the Sound of 2004 top 10.",['and']
The other five Brits winners were already established before Sound of 2004 was compiled.,['before']
"Like every track Robbie has released as a single, its a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before.","['but', 'else', 'as', 'before']"
"Its good if you like that sort of thing, but really!",['but']
Listened to Angels on Radio 1 this morning when I was driving into work.,['when']
Had not heard it for a while.,['while']
"I love Robs voice, the lyrics and tune.",['and']
"As usual, the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest","['as', 'when']"
"Its musically and lyrically inept, and fantastically overrated, a bit like Mr Williams himself.",['and']
"This result isnt very surprising though, The Brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music!",['though']
"Cunning to make the timescale not include Stairway to Heaven or Bohemian Rhapsody, but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really.","['but', 'or']"
Not much competition in the last 25 years after all.,['after']
"I am a regular listener to Radio 2 but I dont recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldnt know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly NOT the best song of the last 25 years.","['but', 'and']"
"While I am biassed in that I thought Love Will Tear Us Apart should have won, in all seriousness, I think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty.","['as', 'while', 'because']"
"Then again, well done Robbie, good show.",['then']
"Angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years.",['but']
I think Angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but I dont think its the best song from the past 25 years!,"['but', 'and']"
"Right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was Will Young doing being nominated in the first place , he is alright but the song isnt that good!","['but', 'for example']"
Think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than Angels.,['and']
"Angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it.",['before']
"Hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon, and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards.",['and']
"So boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in Britain today, for me its proof that music and democracy just dont mix.","['and', 'so']"
"Still, at least it wasnt Will Young.",['still']
"Robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non,fans know the words to angels.",['while']
"Personally I wanted Will Young to win, but that was not really due to his musical talent!",['but']
"I hate the song, all it brings back is memories of school discos and no,one to slow,dance with!",['and']
"Whenever the song comes on the radio I turn the radio up, smile and sing along .",['and']
The song makes me calm and serene and happy.,['and']
"I think that although Robbie Williams is a good performer, that Angels isnt really that good a song.",['although']
It certainly isnt anywhere near as good as Love Will Tear Us Apart by Joy Division or Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush.,"['as', 'or']"
All credit to Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers.,['and']
Its a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.,['and']
"They werent cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.","['but', 'because']"
"Yes Angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.","['as', 'because', 'since']"
"I believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of British pre,teens, teens and middle aged women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as classic songwriting.","['as', 'and']"
"Folks without collections, folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. Angels adds nothing , it is merely an irritating distraction , a wasp that refuses to go away on a summers afternoon picnic. What a dreadful result.",['when']
"If you voted for it , you should feel ashamed of yourself , you probably only know a dozen songs or so dont you , so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote.","['and', 'so', 'or']"
"Last five years I might be willing to accept, but 25, no way.",['but']
"What about all the REAL artists out there over the last 25 years , the list is endless, but Robbie Williams doesnt even come close.",['but']
"That song has become such a bane to me that I have developed a Pavlovian response to the word Angels where I thrash around, and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radios off","['and', 'until']"
"If this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.","['then', 'as', 'as well', 'if,then']"
"The initial list was very weak anyway, but Angels the best song of the last 25 years!",['but']
"I think not, I didnt realize Radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10!",['so']
I think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.,['as']
"Its a mediocre, sentimental and safe song.",['and']
But can it stand up against ANYTHING by The Smiths (in particular How Soon is Now,['but']
"No, Because Im not female and Im not 10!","['and', 'because']"
Ok I like Robbie and Angels is a decent song.,['and']
But it is no way the best song of the past 25 years!,['but']
The shortlist wasnt great but him winning it is a joke!,['but']
Predictable and laughable.,['and']
The British public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed.,"['as', 'and']"
I am a huge Robbie fan and love that song.,['and']
"But I think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.",['but']
"A band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than Robbie Williams ever will.","['and', 'so']"
Theres not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling.,['and']
"Some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but Angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.",['but']
Those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while Angels remains yet another pop song.,"['yet', 'while']"
"I sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now, the most influential artists will argue that Robbie Williams inspired their art in the way that the Byrds, the Beatles and Nick Drake have done for music today.",['and']
"I suppose its confirmed one thing , the British public are consistently dull :, &lt,(  No offence Robbie, but pleeease!",['but']
"No one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of British music, and a further nail in the coffin!","['further', 'and']"
"I think Robbie deserves it, he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in Britain since John Lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide.","['and', 'since']"
"The only real challenger was Queen but hey, Another One Bites the Dust!",['but']
If this is the best song of the last 25 years then the British Music industry is in trouble.,"['then', 'if,then']"
"Sure Robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.","['but', 'and']"
"A sad day for music  Its not the type of music I normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, I recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people.","['but', 'as', 'and']"
But this is not great music. If anything its regressive.,['but']
"Granted angels is a good song, however it really wasnt up against any other proper competition.",['however']
"The Queens song was lackluster, and apart from Kate Bush, the other choices were pathetic!",['and']
"Also, why werent the Stones there, David Bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than Angels.","['also', 'so']"
"What a ridiculuous concept, and an even more ridiculous winner.",['and']
Angels is without doubt a great song but I really dont think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.,['but']
"Dont get me wrong, Im not disputing his looks, but there are more deserved winners.",['but']
"Without Angels, Robbie Williams may well not be where he is now, and Britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists.",['and']
Im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning.,"['and', 'because']"
The Brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales.,['and']
"The same goes with the Scissor Sisters, I think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award, but the album comes no where near U2s new record, neither are they in the same league.","['but', 'and']"
"Once again there have been some baffling discisions made, they are not for artisic reasons, but for profit.","['but', 'once']"
It is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.,['and']
"Its an absolute joke, however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well.","['however', 'as', 'as well']"
The song is overplayed and oversentimental.,['and']
"Out of the rather poor five choices that were left, it should have gone to either Joy Division or Queen.","['rather', 'either,or', 'or']"
I suppose we should be thankful that it didnt end up in the hands of Will Young though.,['though']
"Although it has nostalgia value, there is no way it deserved to win.",['although']
"Everybody knows the words to Bohemian Rhapsody, Nothing Compares 2 U, etc. Much better songs and more timeless.",['and']
Although Angels is a good song I think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years.,['although']
"The Birmingham,born singer, full name Jamelia Davis, was signed to a record label at the age of 15 and released her first single So High at 18.","['and', 'so']"
"But in the same year she also fell pregnant and decided to take a break from music to bring up her daughter Teja, who was born in March 2001.","['but', 'and', 'also']"
While she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single.,"['while', 'before', 'after']"
"During her absence R&B music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning Jamelia had to once again prove herself.","['once', 'and']"
"It was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britains most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti.","['as', 'and', 'next']"
"The autobiographical song, which deals with domestic abuse, hit number one in New Zealand and Australia.",['and']
"Next came the song See It In A Boys Eyes, which was especially written for her by Coldplays Chris Martin.",['next']
His involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to R&B.,"['but', 'also']"
She now combines singing with modelling and supporting charities including the NSPCC and Make Trade Fair.,['and']
"Despite her huge success in recent years, Jamelia remains down,to,earth about her fame and her chances of lasting in the fickle music business, partly due to motherhood.",['and']
"When I first got into the industry, Id be away from home for months at a time.",['when']
But now I have other things in my life.,['but']
"I still want to make it, but its not the end of the world if I dont, commented Jamelia.","['but', 'still']"
"The four,piece Leicester band blends dark electronics with rock, earning Kasabian places on the best British group, rock act and live act shortlists.",['and']
"They have also earned a reputation as outspoken and charismatic, in contrast to fellow Brit nominees such as Keane and Snow Patrol.","['in contrast', 'as', 'and', 'also']"
British music needs a kick up the arse and Britain needs a new band to breathe life into the British people again,['and']
The serpents going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away!,['and']
"Meighan grew up in Leicester with Kasabian songwriter/guitarist Sergio Pizzorno and bassist Chris Edwards, a trio which began making music from the age of 17.",['and']
They enlisted guitarist and keyboard player Christopher Karloff after spotting him in a pub.,"['and', 'after']"
"We saw his long sideburns and thought hey, he looks the part, well ask him, said Meighan.",['and']
"Inspired by Britpop and a mutual love of hardcore, an early 1990s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility, they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound.",['and']
"We got a computer and we cut rocknroll up, because theres no point in going back to how it was","['and', 'because']"
Its all about new ideas and creativity,['and']
Coincidentally it is also the Armenian term for butcher,['also']
"Kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in Rutland to record their debut album, benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there.","['but', 'while', 'also']"
"Signed to the RCA record label, Kasabian tested the water with two singles, Club Foot and LSF, which reached numbers 19 and 10 in the UK singles chart respectively.",['and']
"They built up their following on the summer festival circuit, opening both Glastonbury and T in the Park, and at a series of guerilla gigs at unusual venues including Half Time Orange, a pub next to Leicester City football clubs headquarters.","['and', 'next']"
"Kasabians self,titled album was released last September to widespread critical acclaim, its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to The Stone Roses, Primal Scream and The Happy Mondays.",['and']
"Regarding it as both a fiery assertion of rock n roll ethics and proof that a siege mentality is alive and well in the badlands of Rutland Water, the NMEs praise was typical of the albums reception.","['as', 'and']"
"As 2004 progressed Kasabian would score a further two hits , Processed Beats and Cutt Off , and embark upon a well,received UK tour.","['as', 'further', 'and']"
"We take our music seriously, definitely, but we want to have fun with it",['but']
This is what its all about and without it wed be lost souls.,['and']
But music needs us as well.,"['but', 'as', 'as well']"
"Brits debate over urban music  Joss Stone, a 17,year,old soul singer from Devon, beat Dizzee Rascal, Jamelia, Lemar and The Streets to win best British urban act at the Brit Awards.",['and']
Its a word thats been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music. The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wrong.,['and']
Its so far removed that I dont expect them to get it bang on.,['so']
"I dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by [Joss Stone] winning or her being nominated, or by the Brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day.","['because', 'or']"
"If Joss Stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to, then so be it.","['then', 'and', 'so', 'because', 'if,then']"
Urban as a genre is very broad.,['as']
"If you look underneath urban, there are a number of core elements that include hip,hop, R&B, garage and into that obviously comes soul.",['and']
"So urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub,genres, and there are offshoots of all of those.","['and', 'so']"
"What has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a 17,year,old from Devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really, really good tunes and she looks good , I think thats whats done it.",['and']
She makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban.,"['as', 'and']"
The fact that shes from Devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural.,"['and', 'because']"
"If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain, I think thats where you can call it urban , thats where this new sub,category, or uber,category, has come from.",['or']
"Joss Stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer, but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions , it is coming from somewhere genuine.",['but']
It has to come across as real.,['as']
"Thats the only cut,off point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge people.",['and']
What urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background.,['as']
"Music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi,cultural Britain, then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion.","['rather', 'then', 'and', 'if,then']"
"If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too.",['and']
"Out of all the awards dished out yesterday, Im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award.","['still', 'or']"
"A type of music  that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.","['and', 'or']"
"R&B stands for Rhythm And Blues, remember!",['and']
"If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music  this year its the Streets, although Dizzee Rascal stakes a good claim  She definitely deserved to win a prize, Joss Stones albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year.","['although', 'else']"
"This whole debate about what is urban, what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win.","['and', 'or']"
"She did deserve it, but I agree with the comments about urban music. Its a stupid phrase, and particularly British.","['but', 'and']"
"In the states they tend to use hip hop and R&B, if I say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what Im talking about.",['and']
"If we really analysed it, the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance to.",['because']
"Whilst I agree that the term urban is open to interpretation, it strikes me as simply weird that Joss Stone has won.",['as']
"Urban to me is what I hear being played in parties in the inner cities , I live in Brixton and have never heard The Soul Sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties Ive been to.",['and']
"Good luck to Joss Stone, lets celebrate her victory , lets also question why, with artists so successful and talented as Jamelia, Lemar, Kanye West, Dizzee Rascal, Alicia Keys and Outkast , we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an award.","['as', 'and', 'also', 'so']"
"So, what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black.",['so']
"Shes 17, has an amazing voice, and won.",['and']
"Oh, but shes not black well, lets make her feel real bad about it then.","['but', 'then']"
This idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what Jazz was.,['and']
"The media then called anything that had a swinging beat, syncopated melody or soulful feeling Jazz, much to the chagrin of the artists.","['then', 'or']"
"It would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop, cool and ragtime, all very different styles at that time.","['as', 'and']"
Jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term.,['and']
"If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents.","['rather', 'then', 'and', 'if,then']"
"I love Joss to bits and dont care what her branding is , its amazing music, full stop.",['and']
"Stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music, and lets especially drop the black / urban tag , nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.",['and']
"Surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is  considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from.",['or']
The very term Music of Black Origin has confused and offended many people.,['and']
It appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable.,['or']
"The term urban therefore, has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind.","['therefore', 'thereby', 'or']"
The result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means.,"['as', 'also']"
"Perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/RnB and Hip,Hop, one which does not also mean something else , as we have done with Crunk.","['else', 'as', 'and', 'also']"
"The word wasnt even in use, or common use five of six years ago.",['or']
"Its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music, because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it.","['and', 'because']"
"Im in a band that has been called urban, and I despise the label. Id hate to think I belonged to any neat marketing niche, because thats all it is.","['and', 'because']"
"Ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin, these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity.","['and', 'since']"
"Look at all the TV broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music. Ignore the labels, it is what it is, just music.  As a black man, I think I agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives.","['as', 'as if']"
"Same thing, with Streets, Amy Winehouse, etc. Whos ever heard of Terri Walker or Rhian Benson.",['or']
So what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards.,['so']
Would people be whining because Mike Skinner is white.,['because']
"This reminds me of what happened to Craig David and Soul II Soul in the past, getting nominations are easy to get, but picking up a Brit seems to be the hardest thing.","['but', 'and']"
"Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams.",['but']
"Its music, you like it or you dont.",['or']
We are urban music as far as Im concerned.,['as']
"We live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment, It therefore directly shapes what we write musically.","['and', 'therefore']"
Urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music. Why it needed a rebrand I dont know as the name is misleading.,['as']
"Oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know, therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as such.","['yet', 'as', 'and', 'therefore']"
"All this urban and other such categorisation is just the red,tape of the music business and is best ignored.",['and']
"Urban is a crap, meaningless, politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though.","['though', 'and']"
Theres only two kinds of music: good and bad.,['and']
Row threatens Hendrix museum plan  Proposals to open a museum dedicated to Jimi Hendrix are flailing because of a row over the home of his late father.,['because']
"The run,down house in Seattle has already been moved wholesale once and local authorities are now demanding it be moved to another site.","['once', 'and']"
The mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed Jimi Hendrixs house,['as']
"The foundation moved the building, in which Al Hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956, when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002.","['when', 'and']"
Mr Goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre.,['and']

"In the second, Ms Love, 40, pleaded guilty to possessing a forged prescription and painkiller oxycodone.",['and']
"She must also do 100 hours community service, have drug treatment, attend Narcotics Anonymous and pay a fine.","['and', 'also']"
"The ex,Hole singers lawyer Howard Weitzman said Ms Love had turned her life around and she was clean and sober",['and']
"The assault charge stemmed from April 2004, when Ms Love found musician Kristin King in her boyfriends home.",['when']
"Ms King said the singer threw the bottle at the left side of my face in an angry, vicious and erratic attack.",['and']
"Ms Love was originally charged with the more serious offence of assault with a deadly weapon, but that was reduced to assault.",['but']
"That offence stemmed from October 2003, when she suffered an overdose after breaking a window at her boyfriends home.","['when', 'after']"
"In a separate case relating to the same incident, Ms Love was sentenced to 18 months in drug rehabilitation for being under the influence of cocaine and opiates.",['and']
"Rapper Kanye Wests shrewd soul  US hip,hop star Kanye West , who leads the race for this years Grammys with 10 nominations , rose to prominence by producing songs for artists such as Jay,Z and Alicia Keys.","['as', 'and']"
"He then emerged from his behind,the,scenes role to become an artist as well as a producer.","['then', 'as', 'as well']"
"But his solo career almost ended before it began after a near,fatal car crash left West with his jaw wired shut in 2002.","['but', 'before', 'after']"
"The resulting song, Through the Wire, became Wests first UK hit in April 2004 and subsequent album The College Dropout became a transatlantic success, both critically and commercially.",['and']
"West, 26, began rapping as a teenager at his Chicago school, inspired by the beats and rhymes of 1980s pioneers Run DMC.","['as', 'and']"
"Hip,hop producer No ID encouraged West to sample old soul and R&B hits then revive them with an updated sound, an approach that would become his trademark.","['then', 'and']"

"Although an Oscar has so far eluded her, her status as one of Hollywoods favourite actresses remains solid.","['although', 'as', 'so']"
One of the biggest Oscars buzzes in recent years was for Benings role as troubled Carolyn Burnham in 1999s American Beauty.,['as']
But her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of Hilary Swanks leading role in Boys Dont Cry.,['but']
"After opening her career in the theatre , and gaining a Tony Award nomination in 1986 , Bening had a low,key spell in television.","['and', 'after']"
"She then made her film debut as a sex,starved wife in 1988s The Great Outdoors, opposite comics Dan Akroyd and John Candy.","['then', 'as', 'and']"
"However the high,profile performance enabled Bening to capture roles in a number of big budget Hollywood productions, co,starring with some of Hollywoods greatest players, including Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford.","['however', 'and']"
But it was her role opposite Warren Beatty in 1991 gangster flick Bugsy which had the greatest impact.,['but']
"Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations.",['but']
"Bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for Bening , she married Beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in Europe.",['as']
"A pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered Benings career in the mid,1990s.",['yet']
"She played Michael Douglas opposite number in romantic comedy The American President, and as a fiery Queen Elizabeth I in a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeares Richard III.","['as', 'and']"
"Bening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes film debut which was a critical and commercial success , but the actress had to be content with a Bafta award for her strong performance.","['but', 'and']"
"But current film Being Julia has made Bening an award,winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes.","['but', 'rather']"
"The witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s London sees the eponymous theatrical diva , played by Bening , grow tired of her success and fall for a young American , and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted Academy Award.","['and', 'finally']"
"If best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front,runners would have had to be Michael Moores Bush,baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ.",['and']

"But this years Academy Awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with The Passion of the Christ , a film accused of being anti,Semitic , receiving nominations only in the minor categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.","['but', 'and']"
"Fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the Palme dOr at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2004.","['also', 'or']"
"Moores caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International.",['rather']
But he also believes the strong political viewpoint of Moores film does not sit well with the Academy.,"['but', 'also']"
"If you look at past Oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative Oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic,style pictures.",['and']
"They tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often arent too contentious",['and']
"While he said the Oscar voting panel were not snubbing Moores film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category.",['while']
I think its more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,['rather']
"But aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations.",['but']
"The film has caused some controversy in showing Hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi,mythical, historical monster.","['but', 'rather', 'as']"
But Mr Dams said: Its not an inflammatory film.,['but']

"Its a very accessible film, and it doesnt beat you over the head with its views.",['and']
"While in Fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, I think the way that Super Size Me is put together , the fact its a very likeable film , means its won through on charm",['while']

"Strong Oscar contenders Million Dollar Baby and Sideways did not figure in the Bafta nominations, giving Vera Drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes.",['and']
There is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back.,['and']
Mr Jolin also tipped Phil Davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in Vera Drake but felt that Heather Craney could be outdone by Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman in the supporting actress category.,"['but', 'also', 'or']"

"He,Man and Transformers, which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s, will soon receive their own costly makeovers.",['and']
"With screen versions of The A,Team, The Dukes of Hazzard and even Blakes Seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business.",['and']
But some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals.,['but']
"The new version of The Magic Roundabout, which will be released as Sprung!",['as']
"In a similar fashion, the 2004 Thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the originals puppets and models.",['and']
"Pop stars Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue provide voices in The Magic Roundabout, while the now,defunct boy band Busted performed the Thunderbirds theme song.","['while', 'and']"
"But while some reviewers have been won over, there has nonetheless been a significant backlash.","['but', 'nonetheless', 'while']"
"This CG,animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop,motion Roundabout a cult hit",['and']
And the recent puppet comedy Team America: World Police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that Gerry Andersons Thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins.,['and']
I can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today.,['and']
But I think its backfiring.,['but']
"Despite Thunderbirds disappointing global box,office performance , the film cost $42m  but only recouped $21m  , the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.",['but']
It can therefore be only a matter of time before some other TV favourites receive the Hollywood treatment.,"['therefore', 'before']"

"With only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series, there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat, Professor Yaffle and the Mice of the Marvellous Mechanical Mouse Organ.",['and']
But with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback.,"['but', 'still']"
"And the success of Pirates of the Caribbean must surely herald a comeback for TVs most popular cartoon buccaneer,  .",['and']
It might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed.,['also']
Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy.,['or']
"Its always nice to see these old toons re,released, but after the abysmal Thunderbirds movie (and the song!","['but', 'after']"
Just leave these classics alone as good memories.,['as']
As the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe.,"['as', 'and']"
I believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular.,['so']
As long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series.,"['then', 'as long as', 'as', 'and']"
"Personally id like to see cartoons such as Transformers, Thundercats and M.A.S.K. get full Hollywood remakes.","['as', 'and']"

Love to see Transformers with real actors and CGI.,['and']
And make it at least a 15 rating.,['and']
Part of the reason for the success of such classics as the Magic Roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.,"['as', 'and']"
"They were moody, sarcastic, and rather human.","['rather', 'and']"
"Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.",['and']
I have fond memories of Bod  and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.,['and']
"Its got all the right material for an american blockbuster , no plot and no story.",['and']
Bod would likely be played by Tom Cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two.,"['and', 'or']"
"Its all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.","['but', 'when', 'and', 'or']"
"It maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation.","['but', 'as', 'and']"
"I recently re,watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that was completely lost on me when I was a child.","['when', 'and']"
"Again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation , this time computer created flat,cell like animation , failed to match the originals cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate.","['and', 'so']"
"We live in a sampling world , the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration, clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new.",['and']
"Seems that the film and TV is doing the same now , its just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new.","['rather', 'and']"
"The story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop, steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing!",['and']
If they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great.,['and']

If its going to be an adventure then Johnny Depp playing a role similar to the Pirates Of The Caribbean Character.,"['then', 'if,then']"
"After all, grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know!","['as', 'as well', 'and', 'after']"
"Why cant the British film industry try making Gerry Andersons UFO or Captain Scarlet, or Saphire and Steel, or The Tomorrow People.","['and', 'or']"
"TV shows such as Battlestar Galactica have new remakes, DJs are sampling or re,working 70s and 80s music. Even computer games from 10,15 years ago are getting modern re,workings.","['as', 'and', 'or']"
But of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs.,"['but', 'and']"

But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence.,['but']

A key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings.,['or']
The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence.,"['so', 'so that']"

At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.,['as']
"The general election would be a three,party struggle, as the Conservative party fades away as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands, he said.","['as', 'and']"

Ms Borthwick said reopening the line would be a prosperous move and protect the character of the Scottish Borders.,['and']
"A study in 2000, which was commissioned by the executive, Scottish Borders Council, Midlothian Council and Scottish Borders Enterprise, found that a half,hourly service from Tweedbank to Edinburgh could cover its operating costs.",['and']

Hitler row over Welsh arts cash  An artist critical of Welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in Russia and Germany.,['and']
Culture Minister Alun Pugh said it would be crass and ignorant to liken a quango review to Hitlers Germany.,['and']

The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished.,['since']
"It was announced last July that three Welsh quangos, education and training body Elwa, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency, would be brought under assembly government control.",['and']
The Arts Council of Wales may be among the next to come under the assembly governments umbrella.,['next']
"But Ms James, who won the £30,000 Jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government.",['but']
Ms James told BBC Radio Wales: Its quite dangerous when you involve politicians because its not like the health service and its not like the railways.,"['when', 'and', 'because']"
"You need distance, you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way.",['because']
But she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate.,['but']
"She told Good Morning Wales: Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitlers Germany, the actual quote I gave was: It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control.",['or']
"As we know from past European history, i.e. Russia and Germany in the early 20th Century, artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression.","['rather', 'as', 'and', 'or']"

New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.,['while']
But Mr Straw denied it amounted to a constitutional crisis,['but']
He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court.,['and']
The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,['or']
"The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism.",['and']
"But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the governments independent reviewer of anti,terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released.",['but']
He said the Law Lords ruling was an embarrassment for the government and major changes were needed to the law.,['and']
The ruling came on Charles Clarkes first day as home secretary following David Blunketts resignation.,['as']
"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords",['meantime']
But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland.,['but']

"Applications from England and Wales rose by 17% between January 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700.",['and']
"In June last year, Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by £2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross,border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed.","['although', 'yet']"
"Legislation to introduce the top,up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.","['then', 'and', 'before', 'until']"
"Director, David Caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities, but this was not a major factor.",['but']
"He told BBC Radio Scotlands Good Morning Scotland programme: The reason people are opting for Scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality, they offer very attractive courses and Scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.","['as', 'and']"
"They know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top,up fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated.","['when', 'and', 'so']"
"However, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here",['however']
Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context.,['and']
"He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge , an additional figure of about 200.",['when']
"Also, the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from Wales, where there are no plans for top,up fees, have also risen, by 19%.","['further', 'also']"
"We want to make sure that when students are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland.","['when', 'and', 'so', 'because']"
We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option.,"['as', 'because']"
Very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students,"['and', 'so']"
"Anglers could face prosecution  Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.",['and']
"Sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said.",['though']
"They raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, MPs said.",['and']
"They called for a cast,iron guarantee that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing.",['and']
"The draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect kept animals and companion animals by setting up a duty of care",['and']
"In addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible.",['in addition']
"The bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing mutilation of animals , unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animals best interest.","['unless', 'as', 'as well']"
The environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals.,"['and', 'after']"
"One was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged , even if they were to later fail.","['so', 'so that', 'later']"
We accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the governments intention to exempt fishing as an activity,"['as', 'and', 'therefore', 'nor']"
But the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought.,['but']
"However, in exempting fishing, the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given carte blanche to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity",['however']
"The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which would be significantly weakened","['as', 'also']"
"This was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted , such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering , to go unpunished.","['as', 'because', 'or']"
Committee chairman Michael Jack said: Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest.,"['as', 'and']"
My committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesnt just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place.,"['but', 'before']"
"But Mr Jack said the bill very much had the feel of a work in progress, and urged the government to guarantee that an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms.","['but', 'as', 'and', 'before']"
The government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to Parliament,['before']
But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now.,"['but', 'when', 'and']"
Mr Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been significantly influenced by the recommendations of the Commons home affairs committee.,['but']
The issue would be debated in Parliament next Monday as scheduled he insisted.,"['as', 'next']"
"Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as deeply flawed said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again.","['as', 'earlier']"
"Wouldnt this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary, a new broom, to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place",['and']
Earlier this week the Tories announced they would back the governments plans although Michael Howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.,"['although', 'earlier']"
"They had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration.","['as', 'and']"
The Home Office says people will pay £85 for a passport and ID card together or a undecided fee for a separate ID card.,"['and', 'or']"
"The first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them.","['although', 'when', 'and', 'or']"
The new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents.,['also']

"Scots smoking ban details set out  Smoke,free areas will save lives and improve Scotlands health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.",['and']
Mr McConnell said the countrys health rates were lamentable not least because of smoking.,['because']
"He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non,compliance.",['and']
"Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all,out ban on smoking in public places.","['but', 'earlier']"
"The health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs.",['and']
He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past,['and']
"There are still national habits which hold us back , the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health",['still']
"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over,eating.","['and', 'because']"
"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke.",['and']
"The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service  Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas.","['as', 'before']"
"Main points of the plan:    , A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland   , The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers   , Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500   , Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence   , A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined   , Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000.","['and', 'or']"
Mr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less.,"['either,or', 'or']"
He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland.,['and']
"Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban.","['and', 'before']"
"The Scottish National Partys Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date.","['but', 'as']"
There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit.,['and']
"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations , there are people who are yet to be persuaded","['but', 'yet', 'and', 'also']"
Mr McLetchie asked: Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first ministers brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals,"['but', 'and']"
"The Scottish Green Partys health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the success stories of New York and Ireland",['and']
"Courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, MPs said.","['but', 'as']"
But they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access.,['but']
"They said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non,resident parent in contested cases.","['specifically', 'and']"
"This would reassert the rights of non,resident parents to contact with their children, as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety","['as', 'while', 'as well']"
Delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed a new status quo arrangement for the children to become established by default,['and']
"Although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias, there are considerable grounds for accepting that non,resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present.","['although', 'as']"
"Committee chairman Alan Beith said the five,month inquiry had been a complex and emotive one.",['and']
"At the moment, far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation","['when', 'and']"
"The court system should only be used as a last resort, where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with.","['as', 'and', 'or']"
This will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country,['and']
"Nuclear strike key terror risk  The UK and US must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes, says a top academic.  Amitai Etzioni, a key influence on New Labour thinking, says the US emphasis on an Axis of Evil is misplaced.",['and']
"The priority should instead be on failing states, including Russia and Pakistan, who cannot properly control their nuclear material, he argues.","['instead', 'and']"
Professor Etzioni was a senior adviser to President Carters White House and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which influenced the development of Blairite Third Way politics.,['and']
"Attempts to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work, nor can one rely on pre,emption by taking the war to the terrorists before they attack","['nor', 'before']"
That means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them.,['and']
We must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction,"['and', 'thus']"
"He suggests so,called rogue states such as Iran and North Korea are less of a problem than failed and failing states, which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials.","['as', 'and', 'so']"
He names Russia as the failing state of gravest concern as it has an estimated 90% of all fissile material outside America.,['as']
"And he is also worried about Pakistan after one of its top nuclear scientists, Abdul Qadeer Khan, admitted leaking nuclear secrets.","['and', 'also', 'after']"

"But Mr Makarovs case has been backed by David Kahn , a former Yale historian, and a leading expert on code,breaking, who has confirmed his information was valuable to the Western allies.","['but', 'and']"
"I believe the government of the United Kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities , took the information that Victor Makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold","['as', 'and']"
"Mr Makarov joined the KGB in 1970s Russia, as an idealistic 20 year,old.",['as']
"By the 1980s he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant , and was privy to the thoughts of Western powers.",['and']
"But he had became deeply disenchanted with the Soviet regime , fuelled by its repression both at home and in Poland.","['but', 'and']"
"Through his English teacher, he made an approach to M16 , and then began passing secrets to the British intelligence service.","['then', 'and']"
"He spied for MI6 for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to Perm 35 , a Soviet hard labour camp in the Artic circle.","['and', 'before']"
"Within a week of his release in 1992, he made contact with the British authorities hed been spying for, who arranged a meeting between him and an MI6 agent in Latvia.",['and']
"He was given a false passport, and he says, promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average UK citizen.",['and']
"But after arriving in London 13 years ago, he feels this promise has not been fulfilled.","['but', 'after']"
"After long periods of living in bedsits, with deteriorating health, four years ago he took legal action against the government , and settled for £65,000 to buy a small house.","['and', 'after']"

"The Conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run,up to the next general election.",['next']
Ms Kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight.,['next']
She told BBC Ones Breakfast with Frost: It is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom.,['and']
But quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled.,"['but', 'and']"
I would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision,"['indeed', 'and', 'or']"
It is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes.,['and']
"Head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school, who sexually abuse pupils or other people, who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour.","['and', 'or']"
Ms Kelly entered the Cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then Home Secretary David Blunkett.,['then']

Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups.,"['as', 'and', 'also']"

"The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society.",['and']
"It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism.",['and']
It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged,['or']
"The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities , for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.",['for example']
It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,['and']
"He added: But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing.","['but', 'still', 'while', 'and', 'or']"
This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society,['and']
"Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non,white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.",['as']
"The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings.",['and']

"In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet.","['but', 'yet', 'so']"
"The EUs move was welcomed at the time by Beijing, which described the embargo as a product of the Cold War",['as']
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted.,['and']
"Britain has been more cautious on the issue, but on Wednesday Mr Straw said he also wanted it to end.","['but', 'also']"
"I have long understood Chinas argument, that to lump them in with, say, Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I dont think it is",['and']
He said it is more likely than not that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July.,['before']
But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country.,['but']
If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now,['as']
But he said many of Washingtons objections were based on a lack of information and understanding of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries.,"['but', 'and']"

The cardinal used a Christmas message to denounce the war in Iraq as a terrible waste of money.,['as']
He and the Archbishop of Canterbury have both spoken out about the war.,['and']
"Speaking on BBC Radio 4s Thought for the Day slot, he criticised the fact that billions have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease","['instead', 'and']"
"He added: If the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war, that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears","['then', 'as', 'and']"
"The cardinal will touch on this theme again on Friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2,000 at Westminster Cathedral that peace is worth, always, striving for",['when']

"How can one wish a happy Christmas for our fellow Christians in Iraq or in the Holy Land or those who suffer in Africa unless you and I, in whatever way is open to us, say and do what makes for peace","['unless', 'and', 'or']"
Both the Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in Iraq before the war started.,"['and', 'before']"

"Dr Tamimi said the main issues Muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on Iraq, the Palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for Muslims in the UK and economic, social and education problems.","['as', 'and']"
"Previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted Labour, but more recent studies have suggested Labour support has been falling away significantly among some Muslim voters.",['but']
I think its going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact,['because']
"However, Professor John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by Muslims could make.",['however']
"For the most part the Labour constituencies where theres a large Muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe","['but', 'so', 'or']"
"The constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added.",['and']
"But Professor Curtice said the Muslim anti,war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box.","['but', 'and']"
But Dr Tamimi said MABs intention was not to empower the Tories.,['but']
"We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly.","['but', 'next']"
If the next Labour government has a reduced majority thats a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country,"['because', 'next']"

Ms Whitefield said: I have found members of the public to be very supportive when I have been campaigning on the streets.,['when']
The early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family,['and']
Usdaw general secretary John Hannett added: Christmas Day and New Years Day are special days for everyone in Scotland and the fact that shops do not open is an important part of making them special.,['and']

Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture.,['also']

His party plans to move an amendment to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court.,"['and', 'next']"
Controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the UK without trial or charge since December 2001 was freed from jail.,"['or', 'after', 'since']"

Home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: Its a matter of principle for us that we cant have a situation where the Home Secretary is able to impose house detention now on UK nationals as well as foreign nationals,"['as', 'as well']"
"We think there could be a role for some form of control order , tagging, surveillance, limitation on use of mobile phones , but not with the Home Secretarys say so.","['but', 'so']"
Mr Clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk.,['and']

"They should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and I think they should drop the most objectionable proposals, which are for house arrest",['and']
But Mr Clarke told BBC Radio 4s Today programme he believed the changes he had made to the Bill to win over critics in the Commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the Lords.,['but']

"Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied.",['as']
Many problems can be traced to the fact that the MoD has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase,['and']
"The NAO found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older legacy projects, such as the Eurofighter.","['as', 'since']"
"A senior defence official, speaking to the BBCs defence correspondent Paul Adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle.","['although', 'still']"
"This years overspend was significantly less than last years £3.1bn total, and the Defence Procurement Agency , which is responsible for buying defence equipment , was improving.",['and']
"Lord Bach, Minister for Defence Procurement, said he was obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown, but insisted that the Defence Procurement Agency had undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects","['but', 'still', 'and']"
"The latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months, and, according to our correspondent, contain few new surprises.",['and']
"Our correspondent said it was the same projects, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the Nimrod and A400M aircraft and the Type 45 Destroyer, which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over,runs and delay.",['and']

Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.,['and']
"Laura Brownlees of Save the Children said there were grave concerns, not least because of the well,documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in Albania.","['and', 'because']"
If children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis,"['then', 'and']"
"If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision.","['then', 'because', 'if,then']"
A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children and leave them to rot,['and']
"We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum,seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused",['and']
"We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer,term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that its possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.",['and']

Brown hits back in Blair rift row  Gordon Brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and Tony Blair was harming the workings of government.,['and']

"Government departments get their money from the Treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and thats not necessarily the same as the Treasurys and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government.","['but', 'as', 'and', 'also']"
He also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda.,"['and', 'also']"

"The plan forms part of the partys smaller government bill, to be unveiled later this week.",['later']
Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers.,['also']
And he said a referendum would be held in Wales to decide whether or not to scrap the Welsh Assembly.,"['and', 'or']"
"The precise number of MPs to go would depend on the result of the Welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659.",['but']
"Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall , Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 , they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers.","['as', 'and']"
"It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, Parliament and special advisers","['but', 'and']"
Shadow leader of the Commons Oliver Heald said: This will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in peoples lives by reducing the size and role of the State,['and']
Mr Howard said the plan would also even out the great unfairness of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England.,"['and', 'also']"
"In Northern Ireland it was just over 66,000, in Wales just over 59,000 and in Scotland 53,000.",['and']
The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the United Kingdom if the assembly was scrapped.,['and']

"The government was told that using anti,terror legislation brought in after 11 September to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.",['after']
Mr Clarke said that he was seeking memorandums of understanding between overseas governments and Britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return.,['and']
"However, he added: I do not think the solution to the Law Lords judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help.","['but', 'however']"
"But the Liberal Democrats shadow home secretary, Mark Oaten, accused Mr Clarke of avoiding the main issue with the Belmarsh detainees.",['but']
"And I do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing, for example, intercept communications, telephone tapping to be included","['and', 'for example']"
Deportation may tackle this initial problem but I want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country,"['but', 'and']"
"Unless we get that, the Liberal Democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in March","['unless', 'when']"
But he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees home countries could be difficult.,['but']
"Some of these people are accused of very, very serious crimes in their home countries so its not an easy agreement to get and I think for some of these suspects it wont be the solution","['and', 'so']"
"Daniel Sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions , such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process , in the next few weeks.","['as', 'or', 'next']"
The government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial,"['then', 'and']"

And we are absolutely committed to doing that,['and']
But the Scottish National Party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy.,['but']
"Ms Sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executives support for the policy, there were questions which needed to be answered and, if necessary, sums redone.","['while', 'and']"
She said: Serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the Scottish Executive.,['and']
"We need to know that the money is there, not just for this year or next year, but into the future so that older people, and those who are looking forward to older age, can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met","['but', 'and', 'so', 'so that', 'or', 'next']"

Mr Kinnock added that the second factor behind his acceptance of the peerage was his appointment as chairman of the British Council.,['as']
History demonstrates that its immensely useful for the British Council to have its chairman in the House of Lords and that was a conclusive factor,['and']
Mr Kinnock said he thought about the decision for quite a long time because he had long had reservations about the Lords.,['because']

"As a result murderers who face a 15,year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police.","['as', 'as a result']"
Mr Denham believes the SGC should reconsider its proposals to reflect Parliaments wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence.,"['as', 'and']"
"He said: We want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder, reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances",['in addition']
But a spokesman for the Home Office defended the proposals.,['but']
"We stand by the provisions in the Act that cover guilty plea discounts, which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial",['and']
"There is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences , such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the governments claim to be tough on crime",['and']

The Middle Way group also said Mr Bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free.,"['also', 'previously']"
In a later conversation Mr Bradshaw was told that according to Defras lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was not in fact hunting as described in the Hunting Act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence,"['in fact', 'as', 'therefore', 'later']"
Mr Opik said: Hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the Hunting Act.,['and']
"Now Defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting , chasing away which isnt even covered by the Act.",['also']
"However, all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals.",['however']
"How is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting, exempt hunting, drag hunting, unintentional hunting, a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away",['or']
"Tory MP Peter Luff, another co,chairman of Middle Way, said that the legislation was so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence",['so']
"However, I seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating.",['however']
If Mr Bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence.,"['then', 'and', 'if,then']"

Hereford Hospital Trust caused an outcry when it sent out a letter telling patients that for financial and administrative reasons it planned to turn down some orthopaedic patients.,"['when', 'and']"
Shocked health officials in Powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals.,['and']
"Mr Williams had said he did not think it was a Welsh,English issue, but said Hereford hospital was struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to Powys","['but', 'and']"
"But after the hospital had agreed to the suspension, Mr Williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure Welsh patients continued to be treated there.","['but', 'after']"
He said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between England and Wales.,['and']
"The target is 12 months for Welsh patients, but just three months in England.",['but']
The contract with the Powys health board was worth £7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients.,['and']
"In a statement before the suspension of the idea, the Welsh Assembly Government said the situation was unacceptable",['before']
But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate,['but']
Although we will be challenging Herefords decision we will put in place appropriate care for our patients.,['although']
They will be contacted by their GPs in the next week.,['next']
"Earlier, David Rose, Chief Executive of Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust, had said: It is with real regret that we have taken this step.",['earlier']
We want to continue providing an excellent and fast service to Powys people but can only do this if we are paid to provide the service.,"['but', 'and']"

"Mr Bells speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship , with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.",['and']
"Badly,taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by Mr Bell, and in a speech to the Hansard Society, he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy, public service and shared values.","['and', 'previously']"
"He highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools , which he said included about 100 Muslim, 100 Evangelical Christian and 50 Jewish schools.",['and']
Mr Bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a common heritage and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion.,['and']
"I worry that many young people are being educated in faith,based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society",['and']
Many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in England and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony,['and']
Mr Bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were tricky issues,['and']
But he argued that we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation,"['but', 'as']"
"I would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as British citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non,traditional relationships","['as', 'further', 'and', 'or']"

Ministers had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m.,"['but', 'and', 'in the end']"

"Increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term, the report said.",['and']
"Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances.","['regardless', 'and']"
"Yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives","['yet', 'and']"
Crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before.,"['but', 'before']"

Rhian Beynon of the JCWI said the new rules were not proportionate and discriminatory,['and']
Well be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and well be looking at taking a case on this to the Human Rights Court,['and']
The new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights.,['also']

"The role of registrars who under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office, has been key in many prosecutions.",['and']
"Registrars spokesman, Mark Rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent.",['and']

"Under the Anti,Terrorism Crimes and Security Act 2001, foreign terror suspects can be detained in British jails without trial or charge.","['and', 'or']"
Several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.,['because']
"But critics of phone,tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services.","['but', 'and']"
The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance.,['because']

According to Mr Peston the prime minister said: Help me to get through the year and I will then stand down,"['then', 'and']"
"But he then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.","['but', 'then', 'and']"
Mr Peston told BBC News: My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were.,"['once', 'as', 'or']"

He insisted that he would not be rushed into judgement but would examine the law lords findings in detail.,['but']
My duty is to look at first of all the security of this country and in so doing to consider very carefully the precise legal measures that there are,"['and', 'so']"

He said he accepted the difficult balance between the nations security and human rights but questioned why the home office had made no contingency plans for the present circumstances,"['but', 'and']"
These detainees should be prosecuted and tried.,['and']
Shadow home secretary David Davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of the judgment and urged the government to move as fast as competently possible to sort the problem out in the interests of natural justice.,"['as', 'and']"
The law lords ruling came on Charles Clarkes first day as home secretary last Thursday following David Blunketts resignation.,['as']
But the government was widely criticised for insisting the detentions would continue following the ruling last week.,['but']

"The commission ruled on 30 July, 2002 that the anti,terror act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals as British people could not be held in the same way.",['as']
But that ruling was later overturned by the Court of Appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.,"['but', 'later']"

"But before doing so, he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book.","['but', 'still', 'so', 'before']"
Labour MPs have warned against disunity and Tory leader Michael Howard may well take up the theme in the Commons.,['and']

Tories unveil quango blitz plans  Plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.,['as']
Six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the Tories say would save more than £4.3bn.,['also']
Among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities.,['and']
Tory frontbencher John Redwood said Britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.,['and']
"The plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing.","['as', 'and']"
Their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government.,['or']
"The Tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.","['rather', 'as', 'and']"
"Announcing the plans, Mr Redwood said: Mr Blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made.",['and']
"Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes",['and']

"Mr Clarke, writing in The Times, accused some critics of liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears by claiming ID cards would erode civil liberties.",['and']
"He writes that it is actually a profoundly civil libertarian measure because it promotes the most fundamental civil liberty in our society , which is the right to live free from fear crime and fear","['and', 'because']"
Mr Clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail.,['and']
"He is also expected to cut the £85 cost of the card and passport, for the elderly and those on lower incomes.","['and', 'also']"
"Mr Howard last week said his front bench team had reached a collective view to back ID cards after holding a good discussion, but admitted it was not an easy issue","['but', 'after']"
But former shadow attorney general Bill Cash said there was still very deep disquiet about the plan among senior Tories.,"['but', 'still']"
He told BBC Radio 4s Today the government was intensely authoritarian and was creating increasingly a Big Brother society,['and']
"Ministers say it would help the fight against terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime.",['and']
But opponents say that similar schemes in other countries have not prevented attacks like the Madrid rail bombing.,['but']
That is the sensible way to go about it but I think this government has got itself so much into tram lines now that it is not behaving sensibly at all,"['but', 'so', 'now that']"
"The first cards would be issued in 2008 and, when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them.","['although', 'when', 'and', 'or']"

"Mr Mennear, who was sent the e,mail by a friend, said he had been shocked by the image and had shown it to friends who were similarly horrified.","['similarly', 'and']"
"I am not suggesting there is any deliberate intent, but these sort of things can cause great offence.",['but']
"It is possible the posters were designed for maximum impact, but this one clearly overstepped the mark and should be withdrawn","['but', 'and']"
"The campaign was particularly insensitive as it had come out at the same time as Holocaust Day, a difficult time for many Jewish people, Mr Mennear added.",['as']
"A Labour spokesman denied the campaign was anti,Semitic. As we said at the time the James report  was published pigs will fly before the Torys sums will add up.","['as', 'before']"

"They said as Mr Mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the UKs jurisdiction.","['as', 'when']"
"The other five Iraqis did not die in custody, so their cases had to fail, they said.",['so']
"And it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred has been timely, open or effective","['and', 'or']"

Only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible.,['and']
Other allegations involving British soldiers included the shooting of an Iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four Iraqi civilians in May 2003.,['and']
"I would point out, however, that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority.",['however']
I cant say anything further for obvious reasons.,['further']
"But former British Commander Colonel Bob Stewart said : Anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: If theres a case to answer, lets have it out.",['but']

"And the law protects those who use something to hand as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the Crown Prosecution Service  and Association of Chief Police Officers .","['as', 'and']"
"As a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt, the more force can be used lawfully in self,defence, it said, adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves.","['as', 'and', 'before']"
"But knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of excessive and gratuitous force.","['but', 'then', 'as', 'further', 'and', 'or']"
The Tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use grossly disproportionate force.,['so']
The government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary.,"['instead', 'after']"
Thats exactly what should be the case and I believe the current law provides that.,['and']
"An informal trawl of CPS records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years, five of whom were convicted.",['after']
"They included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in Cheshire, before beating him up, throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire.","['and', 'before']"
A CPS spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder.,['because']

"At the time Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances , for example, if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected.","['for example', 'before']"
"The guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co,operation, he said.",['and']
"But director of the Victims of Crime Trust, Norman Brennan, accused Lord Woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law,abiding public","['but', 'and']"
"In revised proposals from the Sentencing Guidelines Council , the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence",['so']
"Where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty, the maximum reduction would be one sixth, and should never exceed five years, it said.",['and']
In a statement issued on Wednesday Lord Woolf said: I have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the SGC has vastly improved the final guidelines.,['and']
"I am confident, as a result, that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending","['as', 'and', 'as a result']"
"It represents a tougher regime than existed previously, because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity","['because', 'previously']"

"On the other hand, I think his remarks were inappropriate and I believe it is important, and I believe he will, come to the point where he says, I regret that I have caused offence to the wider Jewish community.","['on the other hand', 'and']"

Sport betting rules in spotlight  A group of MPs and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport.,['and']
The Parliamentary Group on Betting and Gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year.,['and']
"It followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport, such as that done using the internet and mobile phones, has led to more cheating.","['as', 'and']"
"The all,party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting.",['and']
"Symbolically, a higher penalty, perhaps as the Bill passes through the two Houses, might be appropriate",['as']
"The report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters, and for bookmakers to set up audit trails , something the new betting exchanges already do , to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced.",['and']
"Lord Faulkner of Worcester, who chaired the inquiry, said: Whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters, the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges , because of the facility they provide to bet against a result , has increased the potential for corruption.","['because', 'neither,nor', 'nor']"
It is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately,['and']
"The panels aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating, assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right.",['and']
"As well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting, there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves.","['as', 'as well', 'and']"

Mr McCabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years.,"['and', 'also']"
"He told BBC Radio Scotlands Sunday Live programme: Here in Scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax, they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems.",['and']
We think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services,['and']
"The councils umbrella organisation Cosla, which provided BBC Scotland with the indicative figures for next year, warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services.",['next']
Mr McCabe has promised them about £8.1bn next year.,['next']
"However, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services","['however', 'and']"
Cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services.,['but']
They say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending.,['next']
The Conservatives accuse the Scottish Executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax.,['because']
"Scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up, what weve seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill",['and']
There are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced.,"['unless', 'then', 'also', 'next']"
"The settlement figures dont include pay increases and the executive is also requiring a substantial figure , in the area of £325m , in efficiency savings across the settlement period","['and', 'also']"
Education will be protected from any cuts but Linda Knox says this will mean other services will suffer.,['but']
On the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.7% but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about 1% in real terms.,['but']

But BBC Political Correspondent James Hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of Whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins.,['but']
Both the information commissioner and the select committee will have to keep this issue under very close scrutiny,['and']
"The Department of Work and Pensions destroyed nearly 37,000 files last year , up 22,000 on four years ago when the Act was passed.","['when', 'and']"

Medical Research Council Professor Nancy Rothwell said Ms Kellys views mattered as she was responsible for training future scientists.,['as']
The Department for Education and Skills would not comment on the concerns.,['and']
A spokeswoman said: It is not news that Ms Kelly is a Catholic but we are not going into any details on this,['but']
But she added that claims Ms Kelly was in charge of a £1bn university research budget were not true.,['but']
It was down to the Higher Education Funding Council and the research councils to decide on universities research allocations.,['and']
"However, it is controversial because it involves the destruction of embryos.","['however', 'because']"
"Professor Rothwell, who is also vice,president of research at Manchester University, told the Times Higher Education Supplement it would worry her a great deal if ministers were anti,stem cell.",['also']
She said: The views of ministers in the DfES do matter as they are responsible for training the next generation of scientists.,"['as', 'next']"
He said: If someone as senior as Ruth Kelly is not going to favour stem cell research we will end up with a similarly schizophrenic system in this country.,"['as', 'similarly']"

"The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan.","['and', 'either,or', 'or']"

The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.,"['so', 'next']"
"Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier.",['and']
"They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotlands regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future , the regiments are the envy of armies around the world",['and']
"An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments.",['while']
"For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely.",['but']
"Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely.","['but', 'and']"
"He said: They dont want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections , far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly","['and', 'or']"
The prime minister said he hoped campaigners concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.,['but']
The Higher Education Funding Council for England said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000.,['and']

"Sir Howard said the report highlighted the entrenched divisions between rich and poor areas, but added it was a social as much as an educational problem.","['but', 'as', 'and', 'much as']"
"He told BBC News: We know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well.",['once']
In fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds.,['in fact']
"The issue is, I think, one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people",['and']
"He said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late.",['and']
"Instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said.","['instead', 'and', 'earlier']"
"But while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge, there were some encouraging findings, he added.","['but', 'while', 'and']"
"Tuition fees and student loans in England and Wales , and the different fee regime in Scotland , did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest.",['and']

Although in the next breath he declared: I get increasingly alarmed by what I read in the newspapers before catching himself on and quickly adding: In so far as I read them of course,"['although', 'as', 'and', 'so', 'before', 'next']"
He probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.,['because']
"As far as the timing of the prime ministers press conference is concerned, there are two options.",['as']
The first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment.,['and']
And there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men.,['and']
It was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that Gordon Brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the governments response to the disaster while Mr Blair was still on holiday in Egypt.,"['still', 'while']"
"Then, as if to pour fuel on the flames, both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, Aid minister Hilary Benn and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott , without mentioning the other.","['then', 'as', 'separately', 'and', 'as if', 'or']"
"All this came amid fresh claims that Mr Brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform.","['as', 'still', 'and', 'as a result']"
"The fact that he used an article in the Guardian newspaper to set out what he believed should be in the manifesto, has embarked on a mini tour of Britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit Africa on the same mission , often seen as the prime ministers turf , has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other.","['as', 'and', 'next']"
"The prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign.","['as', 'as well', 'and']"

"At that stage he saw Gordon Brown and said, look you are the next most influential member of the government, I need your help to get through the next year","['and', 'next']"
I myself recognise that Im going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and I will then stand down.,"['but', 'then', 'and', 'before']"
"But he changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, the book claims.","['but', 'and']"
"I think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private I dont think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed , particularly over this issue of the leadership","['but', 'because']"
"Rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold Mr Blairs monthly media conference at the same time as a long,planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new Marshall Plan for Africa.

And clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster,"['when', 'and']"
Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.,['and']
"Along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues, they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of Britain.","['and', 'next']"
It is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift.,['and']
"Ian Gibson, for example, urged the two men to stop squabbling, declaring: For goodness sake, sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can","['as', 'and', 'for example']"
"Tony Blair will seek to reassure Labour MPs on Monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at Westminster , a behind,closed doors meeting which Gordon Brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.",['also']
Meanwhile the likes of Health Secretary John Reid and Labour peer Lord Haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue.,"['and', 'meanwhile']"
And they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison.,['and']
Lord Haskins even suggested Mr Blair should reinstate Mr Brown as the central figure in the election planning.,['as']
But this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage.,"['but', 'and']"
They believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears.,['next']
"And it matters little whether the rift is real or, as some try to suggest, simply the product of newspaper headlines and Westminster gossip.","['as', 'and', 'or']"
"Few in Westminster actually believe that, simply because the evidence appears to contradict it.",['because']
"For example, the weekends attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick.",['for example']
"Even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories, they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments.","['as', 'still', 'and']"
"Mr Blair talked about the New Labour manifesto , a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor, who has long rejected the label. And Mr Brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year.",['and']
So they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour.,['so']
They started with and are sustained by friends of the two men.,['and']
One only had to listen to the chancellors friend and former spin chief Charlie Whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime ministers apparent attempts to confound Mr Browns leadership ambitions.,['and']
"But it is not just public pronouncements from ex,aides.",['but']
"It is no secret in Westminster, for example, that Downing Street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner.","['and', 'for example']"
Then there are the actions of the men themselves.,['then']
Gordon Brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign.,"['then', 'as']"
"Meanwhile large numbers of backbench MPs insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter, which they believe is a media,only obsession, or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry.","['meanwhile', 'either,or', 'or']"
There are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation.,['and']
"But with probably only four months to the next election, that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off.","['but', 'next']"
Brown in appeal for Labour unity  Gordon Brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed Mr Blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election.,"['before', 'after', 'next']"
"The chancellor would not comment on the reports, but insisted he would not be diverted or distracted from tackling the challenges faced by the country.","['but', 'or']"
Mr Blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for Gordon Brown as old news.,"['as', 'earlier']"
"According to a new book, Browns Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.",['after']
"That is my purpose in politics, and that is what every day I seek to do.",['and']
"And I am not going to be diverted or distracted, nor is Tony Blair, by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip.","['and', 'or', 'nor']"
Mr Brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on Saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do.,"['as', 'and', 'also']"
But Mr Peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other and that Mr Blair had decided in November 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters trust because of the Iraq war.,"['but', 'and', 'because']"
"He then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.","['then', 'and']"
Gordon Brown knows it as well as Tony Blair.,"['as', 'as well']"
"I think the relationship is genuinely, privately, very poor indeed.",['indeed']
He added: Lots of ministers believe Tony Blair will attempt to move Gordon Brown out of the Treasury after the election.,['after']
That depends on whether theres still a Labour government and their majority,"['still', 'and']"
"Health Secretary John Reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging Labours re,election chances and would not be easily forgiven.",['and']
Fresh speculation of a rift recently followed Mr Blair and Mr Browns separate responses to the Asian tsunami.,['and']
Tory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown ofsquabbling like schoolboys,['and']
Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was getting in the way of good government,['and']
A new book says the prime minister went back on a pledge to Mr Brown to stand down before the next general election.,"['before', 'next']"
The chancellor has said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo Alan Milburn for a Labour poster launch this week.,['and']
"Mr Blair told the Parliamentary Labour Party  on Monday: I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need",['and']
The prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour.,['and']
"A new book, Browns Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, says Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.",['after']
"It has caused a new wave of concern among Labour MPs gearing up to defend their seats in an election, widely expected to be held in May, and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the PLP meeting.",['and']
Health Secretary John Reid earlier warned that Labour members would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation.,['earlier']
"He told BBC News: Those who co,operate or inspire these books, in my view, have to know that, whatever the short,term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure, they always do it by damaging the record, the unity and the re,election chances of the Labour Party and the government","['and', 'or']"
"In a separate BBC interview, Mr Brown said he and the prime minister would not be distracted by gossip",['and']
"On Monday, Mr Blairs spokesman said: The prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he believes that what people want",['because']
Mr Brown says he discussed the election campaign with Mr Blair on Saturday and promised to play his part.,['and']

Mr Blair had decided in November 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters trust because of the Iraq war.,['because']
"He had then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from Cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him.","['then', 'and']"
"Ex,Labour leader Neil Kinnock said Mr Blair and Mr Brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage Labour or British interests.","['and', 'or']"
He told BBC Radio Five Live that Mr Brown would never encourage any kind of insurrection or coup.,['or']
Blair and Brown criticised by MPs  Labour MPs have angrily criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men.,['and']
"In what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity, he is due to line up alongside Alan Milburn , the man controversially appointed as the partys election supremo , and deputy leader John Prescott for the event in London on Tuesday.","['as', 'and']"
"Relations between Mr Brown and Mr Milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since Mr Blair brought the latter back into the Cabinet to run Labours election campaign, a role successfully carried out by Mr Brown in both 1997 and 2001.","['and', 'since']"
"Mr Blair told the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday: I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need",['and']
The prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the PLP and were seemingly in good spirits as it started.,"['as', 'and']"
Labours Paul Flynn said Mr Blair and Mr Brown had a scorching from MPs adding: It was a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting like no other,['and']
"Backbencher Stephen Pound said some MPs had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if Mr Blair and Mr Brown did not stop this nonsense, this poisonous briefing",['and']
Mr Prescott said MPs were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports.,['after']
But he argued Mr Blair and Mr Brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services.,"['but', 'and']"
"He had then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from Cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston.","['then', 'and']"
Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential.,['but']
Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,['as']
Mr Blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while Mr Brown says he will not let gossip distract him from helping a unified election campaign.,['while']
The Conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the Liberal Democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government.,['and']
And it was largely that fear that led to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party.,['and']
"The views expressed by both backbenchers and Labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely,held view within the Labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election.","['and', 'next']"
"As one hugely,disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting: It is time they realised its not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt","['but', 'as', 'before']"
It is a sentiment that is now running throughout the Labour benches with MPs eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand.,['and']
"As Paul Flynn said: What has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times, when we wanted to come together, we wanted to lead on the global issues, to change politics for the next decade, the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party, two people we greatly respect","['as', 'when', 'next']"
"Stephen Pound echoed the message, saying: We know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve, not for the Labour Party but for this country, is the appearance of division.",['but']
"They backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped, the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be named and shamed","['unless', 'and']"
"The dressing down appears to have done the trick, with Mr Brown joining his alleged rival Alan Milburn , who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in Mr Browns stead , and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at an election poster launch.",['and']
But the effect of all this is to have achieved two things.,['but']
"Firstly, nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors.",['and']
"Even Mr Prescott admitted that, had he still been a backbencher, he would have been giving Mr Blair and Mr Brown the same message.","['still', 'and']"
"Secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has, to all intents and purposes, kicked off.","['and', 'also']"
"But whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good , or can even be sustained through the campaign , remains to be seen.","['but', 'and', 'or']"
"Even as the MPs were expressing their fears it emerged that, while Mr Brown is in Africa for a week, the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term.","['as', 'while']"
And he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be New Labour through and through.,"['and', 'next']"
"Similarly, some were pointing out that the chancellor, during the election poster launch, once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said.","['once', 'similarly']"
"What all seem agreed on, however, is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign.",['however']
"Mind you, we have heard similar pledges before.",['before']
"Poll Idols face first hurdles  Vote For Me , ITV1s Pop Idol style talent contest for would,be politicians , finally hits our screens this week.",['finally']

"The winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election, which is expected in the spring.","['then', 'as', 'next']"
But opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics.,"['but', 'so']"
"Mr Bell, who will be offering his advice to the contestants on Wednesday, argues that Westminster has its share of odd balls and the show will engage ordinary voters.",['and']
If it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that,['and']
"But Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatchers former press secretary, took a less charitable view, accusing the programme of corrupting politics",['but']
"To give Sir Bernard his dues, Monday evenings opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self,publicists.",['and']
"Among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star, who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels.",['and']
Among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on Bruce Forsyths birthday and Bill Oddie for prime minister.,['and']

"The former Sun editor dispensed a stream of well,crafted insults and one,liners.",['and']
His advice for one young contestant was to get a haircut and a brain transplant,['and']
"I care about myself and when the suns shining I think , fantastic, replied Mr MacKenzie.","['when', 'and']"
Mr Lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes.,"['instead', 'as', 'later']"
"When the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers Mr Brown, he says well, prime minister, bad news, all the houses in Britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax","['but', 'when', 'and']"
"Irfan Hanif, a 25,year,old doctor from Bolton, made a good impression, even if he was a little thrown by Mr MacKenzies suggestion that instead of being treated by the NHS, young drunks should given a good beating and left to die.","['instead', 'and']"
"Mr MacKenzie thought the smooth,talking former solicitor , with a hardline on crime and immigration , deserved a chance to progress.",['and']
But Ms Kelly said she would not trust him as far as she could throw him,"['but', 'as']"
"ITV will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner, but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates.",['but']
Labour seeks to quell feud talk  Labours leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.,"['and', 'after']"
"Mr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair.",['and']
It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.,['and']
The event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Browns traditional poll planning role.,['since']
But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task.,"['but', 'and']"
Mr Brown later told reporters: Of course I trust the prime minister,['later']
Downing Street cited that comment when reporters suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe,"['once', 'when', 'now that']"
"Labours new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years.","['and', 'since']"
"Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country","['else', 'and']"
"Conservative co,chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H. Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English,speaking world, he said.","['and', 'since']"
"Labours election love,in  Peace and love have been in short supply in the Labour party in recent days.","['and', 'in short']"
"If press reports are to be believed, Alan Milburn and Gordon Brown have been at each others throats over the contents of Labours next election manifesto.","['and', 'next']"
"But the pair were all smiles on Tuesday morning, as they joined John Prescott to unveil Labours latest poster campaign.","['but', 'as']"
And the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months.,"['yet', 'and', 'next']"
It was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years.,['also']
"The first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when , in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions , Labours speakers crackled to life with the sound of Booker T and the MGs.","['when', 'and']"
"Then a VW camper van trundled into view, decked out in that most mind,bending of psychedelic messages , lowest mortgage rate for 40 years",['then']
"As the side,door slid open, it looked for one glorious moment as if the Cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together, Scooby Doo,style.","['as', 'and', 'as if']"
"But, sadly, it wasnt the Cabinet who had raided the dressing,up box , just six rather ill,at,ease looking Labour students.","['but', 'rather']"
"Two were dressed as Regency dandies , to unveil a poster trumpeting the longest period of economic growth for 200 years",['as']
Another pair of students were in a Beatle wig and Sgt Pepper jacket to highlight the lowest interest rates since the 1960s,"['and', 'since']"
The remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the lowest unemployment since the seventies,['since']
"The politicians , led out by John Prescott , were soberly,suited as always.",['as']
"The event may have been designed to highlight Labours economic success under Mr Brown, but there was little doubt who was in charge.",['but']
"The chancellor walked side,by,side with Mr Milburn, pointedly exchanging chit chat, as they approached the microphone.",['as']
"But it was Mr Milburn who took centre stage, speaking of the positive campaign the party hoped to stage in the coming weeks and months","['but', 'and']"
Mr Brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of Labours shared purpose and united dedication,['and']
"It was left to Mr Prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellors record and, in a final flourish, to produce his famous pledge card, from 1997, claiming Labour has met all of its promises.",['and']
"And, more specifically, to demonstrate the central role Mr Brown will play in the election campaign, despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of Mr Milburn.","['specifically', 'as', 'and']"
But keen students of body language will have had a field day.,['but']
"There was much forced smiling for the cameras, but only Mr Prescott, who revels in such occasions, seemed to be truly enjoying himself.",['but']
"Mr Milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor, as he spoke, nodding thoughtfully.",['as']
"But it was the former health secretarys final gesture, placing an arm on Mr Browns back as they walked away from the microphones, which was perhaps the most telling.","['but', 'as']"
Mr Howard asked: How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other,['when']
That question was later unveiled as the headline for new Tory campaign posters.,"['as', 'later']"
But Mr Blair dismissed the talk of splits and said peoples priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by Labour.,"['but', 'and', 'next']"
"He can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages, low inflation, low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to","['but', 'and']"
It claims Mr Blair said in November 2003 he would stand down as prime minister before the next election.,"['as', 'before', 'next']"
"But he went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him, it says.","['but', 'and', 'after']"
He again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit.,"['but', 'or']"
"He continued: How can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government, how can they clean up our hospitals when they dont clean up their act",['when']
"Mr Blair said he would not respond to tittle tattle in books and promised to hail Labours record on the economy, waiting lists and law and order from now until polling day","['and', 'until']"
"Later at their poster launch Tory co,chairman Liam Fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how juvenile the prime minister and chancellor were.","['and', 'later']"
But Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy told BBC News: The government is clearly split at the top.,['but']
Later this week Mr Blair is expected to outline the direction of his partys next election manifesto.,"['later', 'next']"
The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Mondays meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made Mr Pestons book.,['and']
How political squabbles snowball  Its become commonplace to argue that Blair and Brown are like squabbling school kids and that they  need to grow up and stop bickering.,['and']
But this analysis in fact gets it wrong.,"['but', 'in fact']"
And there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going.,"['once', 'and']"
"The key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree theyd be better off if it ended , but everyone wants to have the last word.",['but']
"Each participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard.",['but']
Their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on.,['and']
"(In the case of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, successive books are published, ensuring the issues never die.",['and']
"Now this isnt because the participants are stupid , its actually each individual behaving entirely rationally, given the incentives facing them.",['because']
"Indeed, theres even a piece of economic theory that explains all this.",['indeed']
"Nothing as obscure as post,neo,classical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quoted , but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.","['but', 'once', 'as']"
"Its often referred to as the prisoners dilemma, based on a parable much told in economics degree courses.",['as']
"The story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime, and are locked up in separate cells.",['and']
"But the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them, to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime.",['but']
"Clearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut, and take the short sentence, but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk.","['but', 'and']"
"He tells each prisoner separately, that if they confess , and they are the only one to confess , theyll be let off their crime.","['separately', 'and']"
"And he tells them that if they dont confess , and they are the only one not to confess , theyll get life.",['and']
"And if your partner does confess, youd better confess to ensure you dont get life.",['and']
"The result is of course, both prisoners confess, so the sheriff does not have to let either one off.",['so']
"Both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way, even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up.",['though']
The prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades.,['and']
"It is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively, but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.",['but']
"A cold war arms race for example , a classic case where both Russia and America would be better off with just a few arms, rather than a lot of arms.","['rather', 'and', 'for example']"
"But as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other, an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms, results in arms levels that are too high.","['but', 'as long as', 'as']"
"What economics tells us is that once youre in a prisoners dilemma , unless you are repeating the experience many times over , its hard to escape the perverse logic of it.","['unless', 'once']"
"Its no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms, or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on.","['when', 'or']"
"In the case of the Labour Party, if you believe the rift between Blair and Brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest, Solomons wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem.","['as', 'and']"
"An example, is the famous rule that one divides, the other chooses as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children.",['as']
"In the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row.",['rather']
"The cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing, or one more book for that matter, has to exceed the benefit of having the last word, and getting your point in.","['and', 'or']"
Blair looks to election campaign  Tony Blairs big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign.,['as']
"That poll may still be about 16 weeks away, but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing.","['but', 'still']"
"There was a detailed account of the governments past record, with a major emphasis on the economy and public services.",['and']
"And there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly New Labour , although that may continue to irritate his chancellor.","['although', 'as', 'and']"
"There was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges, although the prime minister talked about a New Labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society","['although', 'or']"
"His was more a speech designed to remind people, and some in his own party, precisely what New Labour stood for, and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach.",['and']
"And, for some, that means showing that New Labour actually does stand for something , that it is, as he said, more than an electoral device","['as', 'and']"
"To that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle England voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it, possibly through some gritted teeth, in 2001, and to more traditional lower income old Labour supporters.",['and']

"That might get under the skin of Mr Brown, but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post,war chancellor Britain has had.","['but', 'as', 'also']"
"Probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men, in so far as there is one, is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services.","['as', 'so']"
"An unremittingly New Labour manifesto, as the prime minister is happy to make plain, will stress the importance of that , the belief patients and parents, for example, want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them.","['as', 'and', 'for example', 'before']"
"The chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance, although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle.",['although']
"With an election looming the next big speech from Gordon Brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and, in particular, the use of that little three letter word.","['and', 'in particular', 'next']"

"Now he is back in London as the UK Independence Partys not,so,secret electoral weapon after returning from the Ukraine where he helped , you guessed it , opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko.","['as', 'after']"
"So why Britain and why UKIP which, despite its recent EU election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election.","['and', 'so']"
"I was on a cruise in the Mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was UKIP leader Roger Knapman.","['and', 'so']"
I had just written a piece saying how the English Channel was now wider than the Atlantic which he liked and it went from there,['and']
I think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism,['but']
"A great soundbite, but a surprise coming from a New Yorker post 11 September.",['but']
"It is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better, who dont believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined.",['but']
"Thats international bankers, the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and, primarily, the European Union",['and']
So he is out to help UKIP take Britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic. And he is scathing of the Tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable.,"['and', 'also', 'so']"
"But until somebody says they are willing to leave the EU they cant possibly re,negotiate anything .","['but', 'until']"
Its like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying: before I can proceed with the robbery I want to make clear I am not going to shoot anybody,"['and', 'before']"
"Possibly a very American analogy, but another great soundbite.",['but']
"The basic point is that the EU seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from Britain , and we oppose that and the Tories cannot be trusted to oppose it",['and']
The aim of UKIP is to withdraw from the EU and if it has any relation to the Tories it is to stiffen the Tories spine on the issue by having a large enough UKIP vote so that we move the Tories in the direction they are refusing to move.,"['and', 'so', 'so that']"
But its not just to shift the Tories.,['but']
I think UKIP had a huge amount to do with Tony Blairs decision to hold a referendum on the European constitution and I think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro.,['and']
"And, while we are on the subject of Mr Kilroy,Silk, Mr Morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites.","['while', 'and']"
"Robert Kilroy Silk is not a team player , it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one",['and']
So what is the big plan for the general election.,['so']
"Look, we are not going to be forming the next government",['next']
"As with the 2004 US presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats , just as he believes it will in Britain.",['as']
"So, with limited resources, the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the Commons.","['and', 'so']"
He also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll.,['also']
Anything can happen in the next general election.,['next']
Labour and the Tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice,"['and', 'so']"
"That might, he suggests, lead to a hung parliament with UKIP and others holding the balance of power.",['and']
"But there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises , even while most still believe it is Labours for the taking.","['but', 'indeed', 'still', 'while', 'next']"
UKIPs performance in last years European elections was just such a shocker and showed that Mr Morris may have a point about the new consensus.,['and']
"And after all, he has a reputation to sustain.","['and', 'after']"
What we want is for more people to earn and own,['and']
Tory Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin called Labour a brilliant machine for talking about things but said it did not deliver policies the country needs.,['but']
"Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats President Simon Hughes said: New Labour has lost peoples confidence in a way Old Labour never did",['meanwhile']
"Pressed on incapacity benefits, he said the tax and welfare system must provide the right incentives to people",['and']
"No,one is talking about driving people into work but what we do know is there are one million people on incapacity benefit who want the opportunity to work, providing the right level of support is there for them",['but']
"However, backbench Labour MP Karen Buck warned against proposed changes in such benefits.",['however']
"She told the Today programme: If the policy is seen as being about how do you make the feckless poor go back to work then it is not going to work, on the one hand.","['then', 'as', 'if,then']"
And it is not going to improve our electoral chances on the other.,['and']
Mr Milburn also sought to draw a line under the controversy about reports of a feud between Gordon Brown and Prime Minister Tony Blair.,"['and', 'also']"
"Mr Milburn gave more details of planned reforms in a speech to Labours Fabian Society, in which he also praised Mr Brown as one of the leaders of the partys reform process.","['as', 'also']"
"In the speech, he backed choice in schools and hospitals, wider home ownership and changes to the welfare system.",['and']
"Our task is to rebuild the New Labour coalition around one nation politics that recognise, while life is hard for many, all should have the chance to succeed",['while']
"Voters turned on the party when it failed to reform industrial relations in the 1960s, he also told his audience.","['when', 'also']"
"Oliver Letwin said the government had failed to deliver in any of the key public services, such as cleaner hospitals, discipline in schools and putting more police on the streets.","['as', 'and']"
"New Labour had failed on school discipline because it had not implemented serious reforms so that teachers could run schools, and which would give parents choice, he went on.","['and', 'so', 'so that', 'because']"
"For the Lib Dems, Simon Hughes said many pensioners are means tested for the money they needed and students who were told there wouldnt be tuition fees and more debt have been given exactly the opposite",['and']
"He added: Under New Labour, all households are still paying unfair council tax rather than a fairer alternative","['rather', 'still']"
"Teens know little of politics  Teenagers questioned for a survey have shown little interest in politics , and have little knowledge.",['and']
"Only a quarter of 14,16 year olds knew that Labour was the government, the Tories were the official Opposition and the Lib Dems were the third party.",['and']
"Almost all could identify Tony Blair, but only one in six knew who Michael Howard was, and just one in 10 recognised Charles Kennedy.","['but', 'and']"
"And 4% of those questioned thought the Conservatives were in power , while 2% of them believed the Lib Dems were.","['while', 'and']"
The survey also looked at issues of nationality.,['also']
It found the Union flag and fish and chips topped the list of symbols and foods associated with being British.,['and']
"Many of the pupils also looked on themselves as English, Scottish or Welsh, rather than British, while the notion of being European hardly occurred to anyone.","['rather', 'as', 'while', 'also', 'or']"
"Defection timed to hit tax pledge  With impeccable and precisely,calculated timing, Tory defector Robert Jackson and his new Labour bosses have attempted to overshadow Michael Howards latest announcement on taxation and spending.",['and']
"With just about everyone in Westminster now working towards a May general election, Mr Howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the Tories resolutely depressing poll showings.","['and', 'finally']"
The big idea is his £35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which Mr Howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts.,['and']
And it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the BBC Ones Breakfast with Frost programme.,['and']
"He and his shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now, but without any concrete pledges.","['but', 'and']"
"But Mr Howard announced that, of the £35bn he has earmarked from savings, £12bn will be used to plug Labours claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in Mr Letwins first budget.",['but']
"He would not be precise, but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax.","['but', 'and', 'or']"
"But he did, for the first time, say there would be such tax cuts.",['but']
It is the Tories attempt to open that famed clear blue water between them and the Labour party and return to a traditional Tory agenda that will both reassure the middle England voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core Conservative voters.,['and']
"So it is a pretty safe bet to assume that, when Robert Jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the Labour benches, his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact.","['when', 'and', 'so', 'finally']"
"Mr Howard, however, was dismissive.",['however']
There are disagreements between Robert Jackson and me.,['and']
And that is certainly true.,['and']
Other issues like the Iraq war and the trust thing will also play a major part.,"['and', 'also']"
But it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote.,"['but', 'finally']"
And many on the Tory benches have been crying out for Mr Howard to get back onto the old Tory tax cuts agenda.,['and']
"Mr Howard knows that risks accusations that, as a result, he would slash public services, so he has attempted to shoot that fox first.","['as', 'so', 'as a result']"
"With polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts, he has suggested that is exactly what he will do.","['rather', 'and', 'before']"
Whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen.,['finally']
The money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes.,['and']
"The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his MPs, Robert Jackson, a former minister, to Labour.",['also']
Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election.,['and']
However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives spending plans.,['however']
"The bulk of the £35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said.",['and']
"The £12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added.",['then']
"However, the remainder would deal with some of the unfair taxes",['however']
"Because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both.","['because', 'or']"
"So part of the £12bn we are going to apply to filling the governments black hole, reducing the borrowing.",['so']
The rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today,['so']
Mr Howard is expected to say that around £6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday.,['when']
"Savings of £153m at the Foreign Office and £336m at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, have also been identified.","['and', 'also']"
"In all, almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under Mr James proposals.",['and']
"Mr Howard said: All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less",['and']
"However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: None of the Tories figures add up so they cant make these savings and cant pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is £35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard","['however', 'and', 'so']"
"And the Liberal Democrats will take three key seats from the Conservatives, leaving the Tories with just 163 MPs, two less than they returned atLabours 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906.","['and', 'since']"
"Kennedy looks to election gains  They may not know quite how to describe their position in British politics , the real opposition, the valid opposition, the effective opposition or the authentic opposition.",['or']
"But the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the Tories, who are now the real threat to Labour.",['but']
"As Tory leader Michael Howard kicked off his election campaign, the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy dismissed the Conservatives as a fading force.",['as']
And he insisted there was no limit to his partys ambitions in the coming poll.,['and']
And he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things.,['and']
And Mr Kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the partys Westminster HQ.,"['when', 'and']"
He would make no predictions other than that he expected the Lib Dems to increase both their votes and their Commons seats at the election.,['and']
"The gap between Labour and the Tories was now so narrow , as proved, he claimed, by the defection to Labour of Robert Jackson , that only his party offered a genuine alternative.","['as', 'and', 'so']"
"On the war on Iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives.","['whereas', 'and']"
"He was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100,000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees, the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax.","['and', 'also']"
He was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election.,"['also', 'after']"
"There was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self,delusion.","['as', 'when']"
The other parties will still insist that the Lib Dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats.,"['otherwise', 'still']"
"Labour, in particular, fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the Lib Dems allowing the Tories to win some seats.",['in particular']
But Mr Kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that.,['but']
"He will not talk about the big breakthrough, although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold.",['although']
"They would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the Liberal Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power.","['as', 'after', 'next']"
The Lib Dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on Iraq.,['because']
"But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.","['but', 'and', 'also']"
"Best person for top legal job  The best person for the job should be appointed lord chancellor, and not necessarily a lawyer or MP, the courts minister has told MPs.","['and', 'or']"
Mr Leslie said: The prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the House of Lords or the House of Commons,['or']
"Under the reforms, the Law Lords will also be replaced as the UKs highest legal authority by a Supreme Court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers.","['rather', 'as', 'and', 'also']"
In December the Lords rejected a plea by current Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer.,['or']
The peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers.,['also']
"The debate was carried over from the last Parliamentary session, but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the Bill passed.",['but']
Mr Leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or Lord Chancellor.,['or']
The government had initially proposed to take this institution and smash it to pieces,['and']
Convention should be nurtured and celebrated,['and']
"He warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the House of Lords, the government would have great difficulty in getting the Bill through Parliament.",['unless']
"Former Cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor, said the Bill was largely unnecessary, bureaucratic and expensive","['as', 'and']"

"The memory driving Browns mission  The memory Gordon Brown says keeps returning to him , the one that he says is burnt into him , is that of a 12 year,old girl, whose parents died of Aids, and who is HIV positive herself.",['and']
"And then he talks of those eyes that do inspire optimism: an extraordinary performance by schoolgirls of Kenyas largest slum, advancing with crowded menace, flicking their hips in a manner almost as disturbing, before the finale of a clenched fist salute and shout of free education , free education for all","['then', 'as', 'and', 'before']"
"Mr Browns message generally, that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered.",['before']
"But he is such a pivotal figure in British politics, it is almost impossible not to ask him why he is doing this.",['but']
"His answer, in part, is because of the missionaries that used to come to his fathers church.",['because']
"Ever since, he says, Africa has been important to him.",['since']
But he also believes it is time for the world to see a new Gordon Brown.,"['but', 'also']"
"Not the dull, reassuring bank manager but a man driven by a moral passion , and it just so happens the Labour Party feels an awful lot happier ridding the world of debt than ridding the world of dictators.","['but', 'and', 'so']"
Theres also a sense of liberation.,['also']
If Mr Blair wont allow him to run the election campaign then he can at least pretend it was all getting tedious and hed much rather be out examining social problems in the raw.,"['rather', 'then', 'and', 'if,then']"
It also goes some way to solving one of the overarching problems for all politicians of all parties: scepticism sliding into cynicism about politics itself.,['also']
"If he can help the worlds poor just a little, then it shows politics isnt worthless.","['then', 'if,then']"
"Hes still got to overcome , not only the reluctance of other finance ministers in the world , but also the cynicism of experts who wonder whether debt relief will just be squandered by governments that just wont in the end spend wisely.","['but', 'still', 'also', 'in the end']"
"He defended the package, saying it was a plan for the Tories first Budget and he hoped to be able to go further.","['further', 'and']"
"The Tories on Monday highlighted £35bn in wasteful spending they would stop to allow tax cuts, reduced borrowing and more spending on key services.",['and']
Labour and the Liberal Democrats say the partys sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services.,['and']
The Tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the partys MPs that Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals.,['and']
Now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted.,"['but', 'yet']"
Tory backbencher Edward Leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the Financial Times: I would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts,['but']
"Interviewed on BBC Radio 2s Jeremy Vine show, Mr Howard said: It is perfectly true that I am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much, much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts.",['and']
Mr Howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under Labour and Tory value for money and lower taxes.,"['and', 'next']"
"He added: I would like to be able to do more, and over time I am sure we will be able to do more, but at the start, we have got to recognise there is a limit to what we can do in one go, in our first Budget.","['but', 'and']"
"The latest Tory plans came as campaigning for the election , widely expected in May , gathered pace.",['as']
"The Liberal Democrats launched their pre,election platform, with leader Charles Kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition, particularly on the Iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees.",['and']
Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable also branded the Tory plans as fantasy economics,"['as', 'also']"
Labour hit back at the Tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator Alan Milburn accusing Mr Howard of producing a fraudulent prospectus,['before']

He made his fortune from care homes and health clubs.,['and']
"The 52,year,old on Tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of Cabinet disunity and international issues.","['and', 'because']"
"His spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give Labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the Conservatives.","['although', 'and']"
"Gordon Brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy, but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition","['but', 'and']"
"The businessman, whose latest venture is a casino in Newcastle, also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in Iraq.",['also']

"Mr Bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on BBC2 business start,up programme Dragons Den.","['and', 'also']"
But his spokesman insisted his attack on Labour was not a publicity stunt.,['but']
"In a separate development, Robin Cook gave his support to Mr Browns prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be Labours election.",['but']
But he insisted the recent squabbles between Mr Blair and Mr Brown were not perceived as a problem by the voters,"['but', 'as', 'and']"
Mr Cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was not an alternative source of opposition to the government,['because']
"He warned the Abstentions Party was the real challenge to Labour , and they would not be motivated by Mr Blairs promise to produce an unremittingly New Labour election manifesto.",['and']

Howard and Blair tax pledge clash  Tony Blair has said voters will have to wait for Labours manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax.,['and']
"The two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre,election period.",['after']
Mr Howard told MPs that every independent expert from the International Monetary Fund to the Institute of Fiscal Studies had suggested the government was spending more than it is raising and a Labour chancellor would have to put up taxes,['and']

"Certainly the press conference hosted by election co,ordinator Alan Milburn, in the rather compact new conference room , still smelling of new carpet and with the garish New Labour coffee mugs as yet unstained , had all the hallmarks of an election event.","['yet', 'rather', 'as', 'still', 'and']"
And Ill bet he hadnt checked that one with Gordon Brown.,['and']
"Along with Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Johnson and Minister for Work Jane Kennedy, he then went on to tear into the Tory plans to scrap the New Deal welfare,to,work scheme, which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost 300,000 in unemployment.","['then', 'and']"

"Ms Khan highlighted detentions without trial, including those at the US camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems.","['as', 'and']"
"Whats a new challenge is the way in which this age,old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war",['and']

Lib Dems bold election policy  Charles Kennedy has told voters his Liberal Democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election.,['next']
It is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the Lib Dems and the other two.,['and']
"They are to scrap student fees, finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax.",['and']
"That last policy will also see about 3% of the most well off paying more while others, pensioners in particular, will pay less.","['while', 'also', 'in particular']"
Labour and the Tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed.,"['as', 'and']"
"The Tories claim they can improve services AND cut taxes through £35bn efficiency savings, while Labour has offered £22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance they will propose increases.","['although', 'but', 'yet', 'while']"
In many ways the argument between the Lib Dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between Labour and the Tories in the 1980s and early 1990s.,['and']
"But, unlike the old Tory,Labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services.",['but']
That is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts.,['rather']
"Similarly there is a different tone to the Lib Dem approach to asylum and immigration, with Mr Kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking Michael Howards proposals for quotas.","['similarly', 'and']"
"Once again, with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration, Mr Kennedy is stressing the different, more liberal approach of his party.",['once']
"Mr Kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his partys election chances, declaring the Tories were not going to be significant players in the poll.",['also']
"He repeated his pledge not to do post,election deals with either party after the election.",['after']
"That suggests the Lib Dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful, even pivotal position in a vastly different House of Commons after the next election.","['after', 'next']"
It is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before.,['before']
"In his 22 years in the Commons, he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and, he might say, the UKs political and electoral system.",['and']
But even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months time.,"['but', 'and']"
He still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another Labour victory of some sort.,['still']
And his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the Lib Dems as the real opposition.,"['as', 'and']"
"Therefore the potential is there for the Liberal Democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election, given that we have the capacity to take on Labour and win as well as take on the Conservatives and win.","['as', 'as well', 'and', 'therefore']"
"But havent we been here before, with suggestions in the 1980s that Labour was finished.","['but', 'before']"
We have supplanted them as the main alternative to Labour in whole tracts of mainland Britain.,['as']
And they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary Britain.,"['and', 'or']"
Mr Kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned Labour voters.,"['and', 'also']"
"They are to replace the council tax with a local income tax, provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees.",['and']
He also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to Old Labour.,['also']
"Under a Labour government the tax burden would have to rise, while the Tories plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible, he claims.","['while', 'also']"
"That is a clear cut choice for people, one I am very comfortable with and I think will distinguish us from the others",['and']
"As to his own future, he is clear.",['as']
"If, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because I see that as the decisive opportunity for us","['as', 'because', 'next']"
"That last remark reflects a view gaining ground in Westminster that, if the Tories do as badly as some fear, the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party.","['as', 'after', 'next']"

According to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally.,['because']
Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools.,['and']
Rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools.,['and']
The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated.,['also']
China also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to.,['also']

"He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux,based operating system, We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.  The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory","['rather', 'as', 'and']"
The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down.,['as']
"Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money.",['though']
"In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age.",['as']
"The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.",['and']
"While the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken.","['while', 'and']"
"However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops.","['however', 'and']"
"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, its also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook","['and', 'also']"
Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.,['but']

UK pioneers digital film network  The worlds first digital cinema network will be established in the UK over the next 18 months.,['next']
High definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly British and specialist films.,['and']
Most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images.,['but']

Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light.,"['and', 'before']"
"Writing in the journal Nature, Dr Paniccia , and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang , show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors.",['and']
"Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it.","['as', 'because']"
"Telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light,moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high,volume manufacturing have been solved.","['and', 'because']"
Were trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas,['and']
"While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances.","['while', 'or', 'before']"
"Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.",['when']
It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light,['and']
But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light.,"['but', 'and']"
"Semi,conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges.",['before']
The result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it.,['as']

Card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves.,['and']
Many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though.,"['though', 'and']"
"Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget.","['and', 'or']"
Those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer.,"['and', 'or']"
"In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems.",['and']
"For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.","['once', 'and', 'or']"
The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online.,['when']
The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both,['and']
The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time.,['and']
This can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes.,"['as', 'and', 'before']"

"If you wanted then to transfer funds, for instance, you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction","['then', 'for instance']"
"It means that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode.",['or']
"By the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they cant prove who they are",['so']

The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself,['and']

"If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldnt work that well","['then', 'and']"
Mr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision.,['and']

Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web.,['but']
Bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually.,['because']
To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication  that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals.,"['as', 'when']"

Tough rules for ringtone sellers  Firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks.,['and']
The rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services.,['and']
The first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work.,['while']
"In the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular.",['and']
"But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone.",['but']
If you are not on the operators portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because its a problem of how people discover your services,['because']
To combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers.,['and']
"This tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting.","['instead', 'for instance', 'or']"
Websites such as grumbletext.,['as']
The drafting of the new rules was led by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and the UKs phone firms.,['and']
Consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it,['and']
"Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads.",['and']
The groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if thats done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,['and']
The new rules came in to force on 15 January and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them.,['and']
"Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said Mr Flynn.","['and', 'so']"

The game has been trialled in two secondary schools in Bristol and feedback from students has been positive.,['and']
Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other,['and']
Dr Gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers need for learning outcomes and the childrens desire to rise to a challenge.,['and']
It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge,"['but', 'and']"
It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies,['and']
"Lite versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles , persuading developers to write for the educational market.",['and']
This would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing.,"['as', 'as well', 'because']"

"Sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms, competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers, said Andrew Pearson, European boss of Workshare which commissioned the research.",['and']
The efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too,"['as', 'and', 'also']"
The problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using Microsoft Word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes.,['because']
"As documents get passed around, worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents.","['as', 'and']"
Poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits.,['and']

"Workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that, on average, 31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three,quarters fell in to the high risk category.","['but', 'and']"
"Often, said Mr Pearson, this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared.","['as', 'and', 'because']"
"However, the way that Windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved.","['however', 'and', 'earlier']"
"Few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so,called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed.",['or']

"In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset.","['and', 'since']"
Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.,"['as', 'and', 'so']"
The first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched.,['but']
The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked.,['while']
Then on 10 January Cellnet  launched its service.,['then']
"Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about £2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.","['when', 'and']"
"They became a yuppy must,have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk",['and']
This was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on.,['also']
He said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million.,['but']
Its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,['when']
Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One  was launched.,"['when', 'and', 'until']"
Both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology.,['and']
Called Global System for Mobiles  this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls.,['and']
"Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.","['as', 'and', 'also', 'so']"
"Blogs take on the mainstream  Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.","['and', 'or']"
"These online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers.",['and']
"But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye,witness account of events.","['but', 'or']"
"Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics.",['but']
"The most well,known examples include Iraqi Salam Paxs accounts of the US,led war, former Iranian vice,president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republics government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign.",['and']
"Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US,based think,tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs.","['as', 'and']"
"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before","['as', 'when']"
And blogs were a key part of that transformation,['and']
"Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying we are sorry for George W Bushs victory and the responses from his supporters.",['and']
"Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio.","['as', 'and']"
"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas",['and']
"But they followed the story, they didnt lead it",['but']
"Others, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content.",['as']
I dont think the mission and role of journalism is threatened.,['and']
"It is in transition, as society itself is in transition, says Mr Nachison.",['as']
"However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper.","['however', 'and']"
"And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse, says Mr Nachison.",['and']
"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides whats acceptable for public consumption and what isnt, thats gone forever",['and']
"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories",['or']
"But the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information.",['but']

The site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the US.,['still']
Some web users in Canada also report that they can browse the site.,['also']
The pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers.,['or']
Geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis.,['because']
"On 21 October, the George W Bush website began using the services of a company called Akamai to ensure that the pages, videos and other content on its site reaches visitors.",['and']
"Mike Prettejohn, president of Netcraft, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run,up to the election on 2 November.",['and']
He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week.,['next']
Managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign.,['also']

"In January 2003 the Slammer worm knocked out 13,000 cash machines of the Bank of America and many of those operated by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.",['and']
"Incidents like this happen, said Mr Thiemann, because when banks start using Windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers.","['when', 'also', 'because']"
This often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network.,['and']
This could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system,['because']
Banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network,['as']

A spokesman for the Association of Payment and Clearing Services  which represents the UKs payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal.,['and']

"Typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages, video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic. Geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis.","['but', 'and', 'also', 'because']"
Readers of the Boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the George W Bush domain name.,['still']

"Identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime, and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills, receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish.",['and']
"But, however careful you may be, if the organisations you trust with your personal data, bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble.","['but', 'however', 'then', 'and', 'if,then', 'after']"

"In fact, I suspect that the FSA is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time.","['rather', 'in fact', 'and']"
And it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted.,['and']
"Health authorities, government agencies and of course the big e,commerce sites like Amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters.","['and', 'also']"
"And as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements, banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details.","['as', 'and']"

"Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all Steam players the 20,000 represented.","['yet', 'and']"

We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing,['and']
They just move the activity into the mobile phone as its a much more convenient way to do it,['as']
"While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone ,, especially one equipped with a camera ,, helps them keep it in a different form.",['while']

"This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.","['so', 'because']"

Sites saved in this way can be arranged in folders and have notes attached to them to explain why they were saved.,['and']
Mr Macklin said many people wanted to save sites they had seen but did not want to add them to their bookmarks or favourites not least because such lists cannot be easily searched.,"['but', 'because', 'or']"

"As always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see who they would appeal to and what their role would be in the personal transport marketplace","['as', 'and']"
The personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities.,['though']
Powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much US military research over the years and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications.,['and']
"With an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individuals particular mobility needs.",['and']

Design considerations also exist.,['also']
"Dr Erel Avineri, of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said: The design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled.",['and']
"For example, one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body, making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up.","['when', 'and', 'for example']"
"This and other human,factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered",['and']
"Such single,person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport.","['rather', 'and']"
The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions,['but']

"Among the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience, as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves.","['as', 'as well']"
Academics point out that there has not been any definitive research linking bloodthirsty games such as Manhunt with violent responses in players.,['as']

Mobile multimedia slow to catch on  There is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular.,['and']
"Consumers swapping old phones for slinkier, dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26% increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004, according to analysts Gartner More than 167 million handsets were sold between July and September 2004, a period that, according to Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi is seldom strong",['and']
"But although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps, sounds and video clips few, so far, are taking the chance to do so.","['although', 'but', 'and', 'so']"
"In fact, the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures, audio and video is growing.","['in fact', 'and']"
Getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying.,['and']
Research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to.,['because']
Only 11% regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message.,"['as', 'or']"
"The fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to peoples reluctance to start sending them, said Mr Jain.",['and']
There are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might.,['as']
"No,one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of MMS messages is capped, said Mr Bud.",['so']
"This has led to operators finding other technologies, particularly one known as Wap,push, to get multimedia to their customers.",['as']
"But when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers, the results can be dramatic. Israeli technology firm Celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth.","['but', 'when']"
"While not multimedia messaging, such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content.","['as', 'while']"
"As a result 40% of the subscribers to the Hutch Alive, which uses Cellticks broadcast technology, regularly click for more pictures, sounds and images from the operator.","['as', 'and', 'as a result']"

"James Roper, director of the IMRG, said shoppers were now much happier to buy so,called big ticket items such as LCD television sets and digital cameras.","['as', 'and', 'so']"
Mr Roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for Christmas.,"['as', 'and']"
He advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular.,['so']

The vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes.,['and']
"It will mean the UK will finally catch up with countries such as France and the Netherlands, where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to 15Mb .","['as', 'and', 'finally']"

"Another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of BTs reach, meaning more than 95% of the population could get broadband, regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived.",['regardless']
"There was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1Mbps broadband, they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband,enabled exchange.",['still']
"For thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology, the news meant they could finally join in.",['finally']
Broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators NTL and Telewest also had a bumper year.,"['and', 'also']"
"The biggest news for them was increased speeds, introducing 2Mb and 3Mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512K.",['and']
The cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route.,['and']
"Broadband can seem confusing for consumers, with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products, some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set,up fees.","['and', 'so']"
It is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in 2005 but remains a plane worth catching.,['but']

"Annoyingly, the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them.",['and']
The game has also tried to emulate franchises such as Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank on PS2 and so there are a number of combat elements.,"['as', 'and', 'also', 'so']"
These are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair.,['and']

"It doesnt yet incorporate web searching, although Yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web,based and desktop data.","['although', 'yet', 'and']"
We are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content,"['but', 'and']"
It is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well,"['but', 'as', 'and']"
Search engines are often the first port of call for users when they go onto the web.,['when']
And not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services.,['and']

"Many extortionists are targeting net,based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid.","['unless', 'and']"
But now deep defences are being put in place by some of the UKs biggest net firms to stop these attacks.,['but']
Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures.,['and']
"Net firms are realising that its not just about anti,virus and firewalls",['and']
"Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King.","['and', 'so']"
This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale.,"['as', 'and']"
"Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said.",['or']
It does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing,['because']
"So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave.",['so']
"However, he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted.","['however', 'before']"
"Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days.",['when']
The defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites.,['and']
Its about understanding whats genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,['and']
We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile thats when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack,"['as soon as', 'as', 'when', 'and']"
"This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.",['because']
"Typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi,tech criminal that set off the virus.","['and', 'or']"
Hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets.,"['as', 'and', 'or']"
Most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult.,['so']
Often Pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen.,['and']
"We ask, as part of the service we provide, that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning",['as']
Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up.,"['once', 'and']"
We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,['rather']
Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from.,"['and', 'also']"
Information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests.,['and']

Windows worm travels with Tetris  Users are being warned about a Windows virus that poses as the hugely popular Tetris game.,['as']
"While users play the game, the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks.",['while']
The risk of infection by Cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild.,['as']
Instead it browses computer networks for PCs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines.,['instead']
"When it infects a machine, Cellery installs a version of Tetris that users can play.",['when']
As the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it.,"['as', 'also']"
The virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds.,"['but', 'as']"
"PCs running Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, and XP could be vulnerable to the worm.",['and']
"If your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office, your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed , rather than something that should cause concern",['rather']

There must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework.,['or']
"But instead of fearing computer games, Ravi Purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games.","['but', 'instead']"
One goal would be to break what I believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional,['and']
He believes that the phenomenal ability of games such as The Sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation.,"['as', 'and']"
"The hard part of learning any language, said Mr Purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences.",['and']
"By contrast, said Mr Purushotma, learning via something like The Sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all.",['by contrast']
This was because The Sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players.,['because']
Instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on.,"['instead', 'and']"
"The incidental information about what a Sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said Mr Purushotma.",['or']
By contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context.,['by contrast']
"For instance, he said, in a version of The Sims adapted to teach German, if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word energie the actions of a tired Sim, stumbling then falling asleep, would illustrate the meaning.","['then', 'for instance', 'if,then']"
If necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players or students understanding.,['or']
"However, online versions of The Sims, in which people have to move in, meet the neighbours and get to know the local town, could be adapted to help this.","['however', 'and']"
"Although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, Mr Purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.",['although']
"Getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make,believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes.",['and']
"Before now, he said, educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games.","['by comparison', 'and', 'before']"
"But, he said, using pre,prepared game worlds such as The Sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game.","['but', 'as', 'and', 'because']"
Im encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with Japanese and Spanish,['and']
Earlier work with a colleague on using Civilisation III to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a societys problems can not always come from making a single change.,['earlier']
"A report on the experiment said: Students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play, using geography and history as tools for their game, and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play","['as', 'and']"
Mr Purushotmas ideas were aired in an article for the journal Language Learning and Technology.,['and']
Hackers can build malicious playlist files which could crash the program and let them seize control of the computer by inserting Trojan code.,['and']

Itunes is the worlds most popular online music store with more than 200 million songs downloaded since it launched in 2003.,['since']
"Format wars could confuse users  Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.",['and']
The firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying.,"['but', 'also']"
"The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned.",['and']
Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems.,['as']
"In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content",['and']
"The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought.","['and', 'also']"
Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.,"['as', 'as well', 'earlier']"
The move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft.,"['instead', 'as', 'and']"
"Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple.","['as', 'and']"
"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past","['as', 'and']"
"Its not a two,horse race, its a five, six, seven or even eight,horse race Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own.","['when', 'or']"
"Although initiatives such as Microsofts Plays for Sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.","['although', 'as']"
"Shelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers.",['and']
"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods",['although']
"She said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats.",['and']
Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,['or']
He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy.,['as']
"Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over , consumers.",['instead']

"Once several high,profile legal cases against file,sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from P2P technology.","['once', 'and']"
The expert panel probed the future of P2P at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier in January.,['earlier']
"Since the first successful file,sharing network Napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of P2P technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy.","['and', 'since']"
"But that is going to change very soon, according to the panel.  The music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks , which are not illegal in themselves , and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks.","['but', 'and']"
"But they have slowly realised that P2P is a good way to distribute content, said Travis Kalanick, founder and chairman of P2P network Red Swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it.","['but', 'and']"
"They are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them, which includes digital rights management and copy,protection standards.",['and']
"But, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with P2P cannot not happen, said Michael Weiss, president of StreamCast Networks.","['but', 'until']"
"Remembering the furore around VCRs when they first came out, Mr Weiss said: Old media always tries to stop new media.",['when']
"When they cant stop it, they try to control it.",['when']
Then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money.,"['then', 'and']"
"Once the courts decided that the VCR in itself was not an illegal technology, the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business.",['once']
"In August 2004, the San Francisco,based US Court of Appeals ruled in favour of Grokster and StreamCast, two file,sharing networks.",['and']
"The court said they were essentially in the same position that Sony was in the 1980s VCR battle, and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal.","['as', 'and']"

But the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many.,"['but', 'still', 'and']"
"The global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month, and about half a million films are downloaded a day.",['and']
"Legal music download services, like Apple iTunes, Napster, have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file,sharers away from free content.",['and']
"Sales of legally,downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004, with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months, the IFPI reported this week.",['and']
"But such download services are very different from P2P networks, not least because of the financial aspect.","['but', 'because']"
"Paid,for,pass,along, in which firms receive money each time a file is shared, along with various DRM solutions and advertiser,based options are all being considered.",['and']
Consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together,['and']
But many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industrys potential controlling grip on content and P2P technology by continuing to use it for their own creations.,"['but', 'and']"
"Unsigned bands, for example, use P2P networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.","['also', 'for example']"
"Looking into P2Ps future, file sharing is just the beginning for P2P networks, as far as Mr Broes is concerned.",['as']

Big war games battle it out  The arrival of new titles in the popular Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.,['and']
"Call of Duty: Finest Hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on World War 2 battlefronts including Russia and North Africa. It is a traditional first,person,viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you.","['as', 'and']"
"On a near,identical note, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight,knit team and plum in the middle of all,out action.",['and']
"Its arenas are the wars Pacific battles, including Guadalcanal and Pearl Harbour.",['and']
"You play one character throughout, a raw and rather talkative US soldier.","['rather', 'and']"
"When this works, it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story.",['when']
"When it does not, it is tedious.",['when']
"You are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of Japanese planes, then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman, before seizing the anti,aircraft guns.","['then', 'before']"
"This notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre,determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre,set moments of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic. The genius of something like Half Life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection.",['rather']
Call of Duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation.,['and']
"Finest Hour has a similar determination, framing everything in moody wartime music, archive footage and lots of reflective voice,overs.",['and']
"The games drawback could be said to be its format, tastes differ, but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on PC.",['but']
"The mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphics a top,end computer can muster and the apparent notion that PC games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety.",['and']
"Call of Duty on PC was more detailed, plot,wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready.",['and']
"You can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim, yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him.","['yet', 'as']"
"Checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot, which happens regularly, you are set harshly far back, and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again.","['when', 'and', 'so']"
"The game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that.",['and']
"It is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its PC parent, the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive.","['as', 'and']"
Both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour.,['and']
"And in Pacific Assault in particular, their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless.","['and', 'in particular']"
"But the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial, designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all.","['but', 'rather', 'and']"
"Of the two games, Pacific Assault gets more things right, including little points like auto,saving intelligently and having tidier presentation.",['and']
"It engages you very well and also looks wonderful, making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious Far Cry, although we had to ramp up the settings on a high,spec machine to get the most out of them.","['although', 'and', 'also']"
"Finest Hour is by no means bad, and it is only because the PC original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming.","['and', 'so', 'because']"
Those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented.,['and']
But they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent.,"['but', 'rather', 'then', 'as', 'also']"

"Games, cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years, but 2005 could see another big innovation that wont just see a change in our mobile phone habits , it might alter the way we listen to the radio.","['but', 'and']"
"Finnish handset giant Nokia has been working on a technology called Visual Radio, which takes an existing FM signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures.","['as', 'and']"
"One problem is that the name Visual Radio leads people to think of television but Reidar Wasenius, a senior project manager at Nokia, was adamant that Visual Radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium.",['but']
"He said: Im very happy to say its not television, what were talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today.",['as']
"If you have a Visual Radio enabled handset, when you hear an artist you dont know, or theres a competition or vote that youd like to participate in, you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on,air broadcast youve just been listening to","['when', 'and', 'or']"
"That visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station, and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to.",['and']
"As well as details on the track or artist of a particular song, there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself, in a similar way to digital televisions red button content.","['as', 'as well', 'also', 'or']"
"Possible interactive content includes competitions, votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing.",['and']
"But the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations, who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real,time basis.",['but']
"This in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue, as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners.","['in turn', 'as']"
As the Visual Radio content is transmitted by existing GPRS technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network.,['as']
"And there will be a cost for the service as well, although it may depend on your usage.","['although', 'as', 'as well', 'and']"
If you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact itll be two or three pounds per month,"['and', 'or']"
But typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an all you can eat arrangement per month,['but']
"The payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial,up connections.",['therefore']
"Basically, Visual Radio is not really revolutionary, but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before","['but', 'rather']"
"Not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like, mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets","['but', 'and']"

Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels.,['and']
This means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard TV.,['as']
"Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in look what this TV can do, until HD is really adopted by broadcasters","['as', 'until']"

Net fingerprints combat attacks  Eighty large net service firms have switched on software to spot and stop net attacks automatically.,['and']
Data gathered will be passed to police to help build up intelligence about who is behind worm outbreaks and denial of service attacks.,['and']
"Firms signing up for the sensing system include MCI, BT, Deutsche Telekom, Energis, NTT, Bell Canada and many others.",['and']
The creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by US firm Arbor Networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack.,['and']
"Increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites, launch worms and relay spam around the net.",['and']
We have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic,['and']
Attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination,"['as', 'before']"

This type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines.,"['as', 'or']"
Attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated,['and']
